Abstract
This paper examines public goods and evaluates the mechanism through the game
theory. Public goods are characterized by nonexclusivity and nonrivalry and this cre-
ates fundamental challenges for allocation. We analyze why competitive markets un-
dersupply public goods by deriving the inefficiency formally through Nash equilibrium.
The paper evaluates theoretical solutions including Lindahl pricing, Clarke-Groves
mechanisms, and voting schemes. The paper will cover their efficiency properties and
practical limitations. We show how strategic interaction leads to free-riding behavior
using roommates dilemma and other examples. We also cover why a large household
lives in messy conditions not because individuals are lazy, but because they are rational
players in a Nash equilibrium. We also examine voting mechanisms, the median voter
theorem, and recent developments in truth-revealing mechanisms

Introduction
A public good is defined by two critical properties: nonrivalry and nonexclusivity. Nonri-
valry means that the marginal cost of serving an additional user is zero, enabling multiple
individuals to consume the same unit simultaneously without diminishing others’ consump-
tion.
Consumption of one more burger equires that various resources be devoted to its
production. Nonexclusivity implies that no one can be prevented from consuming the good,
even if they do not pay for it. Classic examples include national defense, radio broadcasts,
street lighting, and environmental protection.

The concepts of nonexclusion and nonrivalry are in some ways related. Many nonexclusive
goods are also nonrival. National defense and mosquito control are two examples of goods
for which exclusion is not possible and additional consumption takes place at zero marginal
cost. Many other instances might be suggested. The concepts, are not identical: Some goods
may possess one property but not the other. For example, it is impossible (or at least very
costly) to exclude some fishing boats from ocean fisheries, yet the arrival of another boat
clearly imposes social costs in the form of a reduced catch for all con cerned. Similarly, use
of a bridge during off-peak hours may be nonrival, but it is possible to exclude potential
users by erecting toll booths [1].
These characteristics fundamentally distinguish public goods from private goods and
challenge the assumptions underlying the efficiency of competitive markets. In private good
markets, individuals reveal their preferences through purchasing decisions, and market prices
coordinate supply and demand efficiently. Public goods, however, lack both the revealing
mechanism of prices and the excludability necessary to prevent free-riding, which ibs some-
thing we will delve later into this paper. This in turn creates the central economic problem:
public goods tend to be undersupplied in market economies.

Ths strategic nature of public goods provision means that individuals’ decisions are in-
terdepent. Unlike private goods where one’s consumption is independent of others, in public
goods settings, each consumer derives a benefit from the purchases of the other. This link
between the consumers is absent with private goods and introduces strategic interaction into
the decision processes. With the strategic interaction the consumers are involved in a game,
so equilibrium is found using the concept of a Nash equilibrium and this is where game
theory comes into play.

1.1
Why Public Goods Matter
The characteristics of public goods create deviations from the conditions required for compet-
itive markets to achieve Pareto efficiency. In private good markets, prices reveal preferences
and coordinate supply and demand efficiently. But with public goods, the nonexcludability
prevents the price mechanism from functioning properly, while nonrivalry means that the
efficient allocation differs fundamentally from private goods.
This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 establishes the mathematical framework for
analyzing public goods provision. Section 3 demonstrates market failure through Nash equi-
librium analysis. Section 4 examines the free rider problem in detail. Section 5 evaluates
theoretical solutions including Lindahl pricing and Clarke-Groves mechanisms. Sections 6-7
analyze voting mechanisms and political economy models.

Mathematical Foundations
2.1
General Equilibrium Model Setup
Consider an economy with two individuals, A and B. This simplifies the mathematical
buildup and makes it easier to approach the general solution.. Each individual has a utility
function depending on consumption of a public good x and a private good: UA(x, yA) and
UB(x, yB).
Labor is the only input in this economy. Person A has endowment lA units of labor.
These units of labor can be allocated to producing the public good lx
A or the private good
ly
A, subject to:
lx
A + ly
A = lA
(1)
Person B faces a similar constraint with endowment lB. The total labor endowment is
l = lA + lB.
2.2
Production Functions
Public good production depends on combined labor inputs from both individuals:
x = f(lx
A + lx
B)
(2)
This equation captures the essential nature of x as a public good.
Nonexclusivity is
reflected by the fact that as A’s labor input increases the amount of x that B consumes, A
cannot prevent B from enjoying the fruits of A’s labor, and vice versa. Nonrivalry is reflected
3


by the fact that consumption of x by each person equals the total amount of x produced
and A’s consumption does not diminish what B can consume.
Private good production depends on separate labor inputs:
yA = g(ly
A),
yB = g(ly
B)
(3)
2.3
Efficiency Conditions: The Samuelson Rule
To find the socially efficient outcome, we maximize one person’s utility (say A’s) for a given
level of B’s utility. The Lagrangian in this case will be:
L = UA(f(·), g(ly
A)) + λ[UB(f(·), g(ly
B)) −¯U]
(4)
where ¯U is a constant representing B’s utility level.
Taking first-order conditions with respect to ly
A and ly
B and solving yields:
∂UA/∂x
∂UA/∂yA
+ ∂UB/∂x
∂UB/∂yB
= g′
f ′
(5)
This is simply:
MRSA + MRSB = RPT
(6)
This is the Samuelson condition by Paul Samuelson in 1954. It states that the sum of
each individual’s marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between the public and private good
should equal the rate of change for product cost (the marginal cost(MC)).
The intuition behind it is as follows. For Public goods, the MRS in consumption must
be the total amount of the private good that all consumers would collectively be willing to
give up to get one more unit of x. This is because everyone obtains the benefits of extra
x output. It contrasts sharply with private goods, where each consumer’s MRS is equated
individually to the price ratio.
2.4
Vertical Summation of Demand
The Samuelson condition states that demand curves for public goods must be summed
vertically rather than horizontally. The socially optimal price for any quantity of public
good equals to the sum of what each individual would pay .
This simply means their
combined marginal valuations
Thus if there are n consumers with individual inverse demand curves Pi(Q). The aggre-
4


gate demand for a public good will be:
P(Q) =
n
X
i=1
Pi(Q)
(7)
This vertical summation reflects that all consumers simultaneously benefit from each unit
of the public good.
3
Market Failure Under Competition
3.1
Why Competitive Markets Fail
Production of goods x and y in competitive markets will fail to achieve the efficiency condition
in the samuelson Equation (6). When prices are perfectly competitive at px and py. Each
individual will equate his or her MRS to the price ratio px/py.
Profit maximization by
producers leads to equality between the rate of product transformation and the price ratio:
MRSA = MRSB = px
py
= RPT
(8)
This violates the Samuelson condition. The price ratio px/py is too low and it provides
insufficient incentive to produce x. In the private markets, a consumer doesn’t take into
account how their spending on the public good benefits others. Thus, they devote too few
resources to its production.
The allocation failure can be because of how private markets sum individual demands.
The market demand curve reports marginal valuation for a single consumer. For public
goods, the value of producing one more unit is the sum of each consumer’s valuation as all
benefit simultaneously.
3.2
Inefficiency of Nash Equilibrium
Generally, independent decision making fails to produce efficiency. This happens even with
strategic agents who understand the game structure. Consider the voluntary contribution
mechanism where each agent i chooses contribution gi to maximize:
Πi(gi, g−i) = Ui
 
Mi −gi,
n
X
j=1
gj
!
(9)
where Mi is agent i’s income and g−i represents all other agents’ contributions.
5


A Nash equilibrium is a contribution profile (g∗
1, . . . , g∗
n) where:
Πi(g∗
i , g∗
−i) ≥Πi(gi, g∗
−i)
∀gi ≥0, ∀i
(10)
For an interior solution where g∗
i > 0, the first-order condition is:
−∂Ui
∂xi
+ ∂Ui
∂G = 0
(11)
This implies that each agent equates their private marginal benefit to the marginal cost
i.e PMB = PMC. This means the agent ignores benefits that spill over to others and makes
sure their benefits equal costs. With n agents, individual i only captures 1/n of the total
benefit when the good is enjoyed equally. This leads to systematic underprovision.
The public-good problem worsens as the number of agents increases. In the limit as
n →∞, any one person may provide essentially none of the public good, becoming a pure
free rider.
4
The Free Rider Problem
The free rider problem is a market failure that occurs when individuals benefit from a public
good or service without paying for it. It leads to under-provision because there is little
incentive for people to contribute and thus it becomes a failure.
4.1
The Roommates Dilemma: A Numerical Example
To understand the free rider problem, let us consider two roommates A and B. Both have
identical Cobb-Douglas preferences:
UA(x, yA) = x1/3y2/3
A
(12)
where yA is hours A spends reading (in this case will be the private good) and x = xA+xB
is total hours spent cleaning the room (the public good). Each roommate has 10 hours per
week available, so the budget constraint is:
xi + yi = 10
(13)
6


4.1.1
Nash Equilibrium Calculation
Roommate A maximizes utility with repect to B’s contribution xB. Then the Lagrangian is:
L = (xA + xB)1/3y2/3
A
+ λ(10 −xA −yA)
(14)
The first-order conditions:
∂L
∂xA
= 1
3(xA + xB)−2/3y2/3
A
−λ = 0
(15)
∂L
∂yA
= 2
3(xA + xB)1/3y−1/3
A
−λ = 0
(16)
Solving for y by equating (15) & (16) using λ gives:
yA = 2(xA + xB)
(17)
By substituting (17) into the budget constraint would yield:
10 = xA + yA = xA + 2(xA + xB) = 3xA + 2xB
(18)
By symmetry, xA = xB = x∗. This is in equilibrium. Therefore:
10 = 3x∗+ 2x∗= 5x∗=⇒x∗= 2
(19)
Each roommate contributes 2 hours to cleaning. The total cleaning will be x = 4 hours.
The Equilibrium utilities for both roommates will be:
UA = UB = 41/3 · (20/3)2/3 ≈6.3
(20)
4.1.2
Efficient Allocation
For Cobb-Douglas preferences, the marginal rate of substitution will be:
MRSA = ∂UA/∂x
∂UA/∂yA
= yA
2x
(21)
From earlier we can also state that the Samuelson condition requires:
MRSA + MRSB = yA
2x + yB
2x = 1
(22)
7


By symmetry, yA = yB = y∗, so:
2y∗
2x∗= 1 =⇒y∗= x∗
(23)
Using the combined budget constraint 20 = x∗+ yA + yB = 3x∗, we get:
x∗= 20
3 ≈6.67,
xA = xB = 10
3 ≈3.33
(24)
Thus the efficient utilities for both roommates are are:
UA = UB =
20
3
1/3 20
3
2/3
= 20
3 ≈6.67
(25)
4.1.3
Comparison and the Free Rider Problem
The Nash equilibrium suggests too little cleaning. 2 hours each compared to 3.3 hours each
in the efficient allocation. The gap comes because each roommate ignores the benefit the
other roommate will get by them cleaning. Utility at Nash equilibrium (6.3) is lower than
at the efficient allocation (6.67). The utility loss per roommate is:
Utility Loss = U ∗−U NE = 6.67 −6.35 = 0.32 (approximately 4.8% reduction)
(26)
This is the cost of free-riding: individually rational behavior produces collectively inferior
outcomes.
This is comparable to the Prisoner’s Dilemma. The Nash equilibrium (both contribute
little) is Pareto dominated by another outcome (both contribute more). yet neither has any
incentive to deviate.

Example 2: Three People in a Dorm

3 player game
Now consider a dormitory with three residents A, B, and C. All three with identical Cobb-
Douglas preferences:
Ui(x, yi) = x1/3y2/3
i
,
i ∈{A, B, C}
(27)
Each has 10 hours available. The total cleaning hours will be denoted by: x = xA +xB +
xC.
8


4.2.2
Nash Equilibrium
We can find th enash equilibrium by using symmetry. As each resident faces the same best
response. Let us look at how resident A’s will optimize their output:
Maximize (xA + xB + xC)1/3y2/3
A
subject to xA + yA = 10
The best response function will then be:
yA = 2(xA + xB + xC) =⇒xA = 10 −2(xB + xC)
3
(28)
Again by symmetry in equilibrium xA = xB = xC = x∗, we will get:
x∗= 10 −2(2x∗)
3
= 10 −4x∗
3
=⇒3x∗= 10 −4x∗=⇒7x∗= 10 =⇒x∗= 10
7 ≈1.43
(29)
Each person contributes approximately 1.43 hours, with total cleaning x = 30
7 ≈4.29
hours. Leisure is yi = 10 −10

7 ≈8.57 hours.

(31)
4.2.3
Efficient Allocation
The Samuelson condition with three identical agents is:
MRSA + MRSB + MRSC = yA + yB + yC
2x
= 1
(32)
By symmetry, yA = yB = yC = y∗and xA = xB = xC at efficiency. The combined budget
constraint is:
x + 3y = 30
(33)
With y = x from the Samuelson condition:
x + 3x = 30 =⇒x∗= 30
4 = 7.5
(34)
Each person contributes xi = 2.5 hours, with leisure y∗= 7.5 hours.

Efficient Utilities:
U ∗
i = (7.5)1/3 · (7.5)2/3 = 7.5 ≈7.50
(35)
4.2.4
Comparison
The inefficiency worsens with group size:

When there are three people, each person’s private benefit from their contribution is
only 1/3 of the total social benefit. This weaker personal incentive leads to more severe
underprovision (1.43 vs. 2.5 hours). The utility loss grows to 18.4%.
4.3
The Free Rider Problem with Many Agents
As seen in the previous example, the problem intensifies as the number of agents grows.
With n roommates, symmetric equilibrium requires:
10 = xA + yA = xA + 2nxA = (2n + 1)xA
(36)
Thus:
xA =
10
2n + 1
(37)
As n →∞, each roommate’s contribution approaches zero. Yet the efficient contribution
remains constant at xA = 10/3 per person, independent of n.
This result demonstrates why large groups often fail to provide public goods voluntarily.
A fraternity or large household lives in messy conditions not because individuals are lazy,
but because they are rational. In the Nash equilibrium case, it is best for them to free-ride.

Mechanisms for Solving the Public Goods Problem
5.1
Lindahl Pricing
Erik Lindahl proposed an elegant conceptual solution in the 1920s[1]. Lindahl suggested
individuals might voluntarily consent to be taxed for beneficial public goods if they knew
10


others were also being taxed. Here tax shares reflect individual benefits.
5.1.1
The Lindahl Mechanism
Each individual i is quoted a personalized tax share αi. It represents their proportion of the
public good’s cost. Individual A chooses the level of public good x to maximize:
UA(x, g(lA −αAf(x)))
(38)
The first-order condition is:
∂UA/∂x
∂UA/∂yA
= αA · g′
f ′ = αA · RPT
(39)
Similarly, individual B chooses x and satisfies the following:
MRSB = αB · RPT
(40)
A Lindahl equilibrium occurs where αA + αB = 1—tax contributions precisely fund
the public good. At this equilibrium:
MRSA + MRSB = (αA + αB) · RPT = RPT
(41)
This satisfies the Samuelson condition and thus achieves Pareto efficiency!
5.1.2
Application to the Roommates
If social convention suggests each roommate contributes half the cleaning effort (αA = αB =
1/2), each faces an effective price of 1/2 hour of personal effort per hour of total cleaning.
With Cobb-Douglas preferences, each spends 1/3 of their 10-hour budget on cleaning at this
price:
xA = xB = 1
3 · 10 ·
1
1/2 = 20
3
(42)
Total cleaning is x = 20/3, exactly the efficient level. This illustrates how appropriate
personalized pricing achieves efficiency.
5.2
The Clarke-Groves (VCG) Mechanism
Theodore Groves and Edward Clarke independently developed mechanisms that incentivize
truthful preference revelation through clever tax schemes[1].
11


5.2.1
Mechanism Design
Suppose n individuals consider a public project. Each has private valuation vi. The govern-
ment asks each to report valuation ˆvi, then:
1. Implements the project if and only if P
i ˆvi ≥0
2. Charges each individual i a tax ti if the project is implemented, it can be represented as:
ti =
X
j̸=i
ˆvj
(43)
Otherwise, there will be a zero tax.
5.2.2
Incentive Compatibility
Individual i’s utility from reporting ˆvi when true valuation is vi is:
Ui(ˆvi) =



vi −ti = vi −P
j̸=i ˆvj
if project implemented
0
otherwise
(44)
The project is implemented when ˆvi + P
j̸=i ˆvj ≥0. Note that P
j̸=i ˆvj is independent of
i’s report.
Therefore:
- When it is beneficial to i, vi > 0. Thus, reporting truthfully will ensure the project proceeds
- When it is harmful to i, vi < 0. Reporting prevents implementation
Truthful revelation ˆvi = vi is a dominant strategy. It is optimal regardless of what
other agents report.
5.2.3
The Budget Deficit Problem
Clarke-Groves mechanisms face a critical limitation. It typically runs a budget deficits even
after achieving truthful revelation and efficiency.
Total revenue collected is:
R =
n
X
i=1
ti =
n
X
i=1
X
j̸=i
ˆvj = (n −1)
n
X
i=1
vi
(45)
The project costs C. It’s implemented when P
i vi ≥C. The revenue is (n −1) P
i vi.
Unless n = 2, revenue doesn’t cover costs exactly and simply the mechanism runs a surplus
12


or deficit.
This budget imbalance prevents full implementation of Clarke-Groves in practice. Re-
distributing surplus or financing deficits typically requires distortionary taxation. Which
undermines efficiency gains.
6
Voting and Resource Allocation
Many public goods decisions are made through voting rather than markets. Understanding
how voting mechanisms perform is crucial for analyzing real-world public provision.
6.1
Majority Rule
While commonly used, majority rule is not obviously optimal. Different institutions require
different decisive proportions:
- Simple majority (50%+1) for most legislation
- Two-thirds (67%) for U.S. Constitutional amendments
- Unanimous wins for some organizations (Quaker meetings)
Our analysis focuses on simple majority rule. The choice of threshold significantly affects
outcomes.
6.2
The Paradox of Voting
In the 1780s, Condorcet discovered that majority rule may cycle endlessly without reaching
equilibrium.
Consider three voters: Smith, Jones, and Fudd. Each choosing among three public good
spending levels (A=low, B=medium, C=high) with preferences:
Choice 1
Choice 2
Choice 3
Smith
A
B
C
Jones
B
C
A
Fudd
C
A
B
Comparing options pairwise:
- A vs. B: A wins (Smith and Fudd favor A)
- A vs. C: C wins (Jones and Fudd favor C)
- C vs. B: B wins (Smith and Jones favor B)
We cycle: A ≻B ≻C ≻A. No stable outcome exists. The final choice depends on
agenda setting or when voting stops. These factors are unrelated to actual preferences.
13


6.3
Single-Peaked Preferences and the Median Voter Theorem
Duncan Black showed in 1948 that cycles can be avoided with restrictions on preferences. If
preferences are single-peaked (having only one local maximum) then majority rule selects
the median voter’s preferred outcome.
Single-peaked means that as the policy variable (e.g., spending level) increases, utility first
rises to a peak then declines This happens without multiple local maxima. In Condorcet’s
example, Fudd’s preferences causes the cycle and has two peaks (A and C).
Now, instead Fudd had preferences peaked only at C, then option B would defeat both
A and C by 2-to-1 votes. Option B is Jones’s preferred choice, Jones is the median voter
whose preferences lie between Smith (preferring A) and Fudd (preferring C).
Figure 1: This figure illustrates the preferences in the Table above. Smith’s and Jones’s
preferences are single peaked, but Fudd’s have two local peaks and these yield the voting
paradox. If Fudd’s preferences had instead been single peaked (the dashed line), then option
B would have been chosen as the preferred choice of the median voter (Jones).
Median Voter Theorem: With single-peaked preferences over a one-dimensional policy
space, the majority rule selects the preferred policy of the median voter. This theorem is
foundational for political economy models. It predicts that political competition drives policy
toward the median voter’s preferences.

A Political Economy Model
7.1
Setup
Consider a community with n voters, each with income yi.
Utility depends on private
consumption ci and a public good g:
Ui(ci, g) = ci + f(g)
(46)
where f ′ > 0 and f ′′ < 0 (concave benefits from public good).
The public good is financed by proportional income taxation at rate t, so:
ci = (1 −t)yi
(47)
The government budget constraint is:
g = t
n
X
j=1
yj = tn¯y
(48)
where ¯y is average income.
7.2
Individual Preferences
Each individual chooses preferred g to maximize:
Ui(g) =

1 −g
n¯y

yi + f(g) = yi −yi
n¯yg + f(g)
(49)
First-order condition:
f ′(g∗
i ) = yi
n¯y
(50)
This shows that desired spending on g is inversely related to income. High-income voters
pay more in taxes (proportional to income) but receive the same benefits as low-income
voters. Thus, high-income voters prefer less public spending.
7.3
Median Voter Equilibrium
Under majority rule, the level of g chosen is that preferred by the voter with median income
ym:
f ′(g∗) = ym
n¯y
(51)
15


Since income distributions are typically right-skewed implying ym < ¯y. This implies:
f ′(g∗) = ym
n¯y < ¯y
n¯y = 1
n
(52)
The more unequal the income distribution (larger gap between ym and ¯y), the higher the
equilibrium tax rate and public spending.

Conclusion
Public goods present fundamental challenges to market-based resource allocation. The com-
bination of nonexclusivity and nonrivalry creates incentives for free-riding. This leads com-
petitive markets and strategic voluntary contribution games to undersupply public goods
relative to Pareto-efficient levels.
