ABSTRACT
Task scheduling with constrained time intervals and limited resources remains a fundamental chal-
lenge across domains such as manufacturing, logistics, cloud computing, and healthcare. This study
presents a novel variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) designed to
address the task scheduling problem formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) model. The proposed method, referred to as Quantum Time Interval Scheduler (QTIS),
integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks,
enhancing the enforcement of scheduling constraints. Two complementary implementations are ex-
plored for overlap detection: a quantum approach based on RY rotations and CCNOT gates, and a
classical alternative relying on preprocessed interval comparisons.
QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian, HP , into two components, each parameterized by a
distinct angle. The first component encodes the objective function, while the second captures penalty
terms associated with overlapping intervals, which are controlled by the auxiliary circuit.
Subsequently, three minimization strategies are evaluated: standard QAOA, T-QAOA, and HT-
QAOA, showing that employing separate parameters for the different components of the problem
Hamiltonian leads to lower energy values and improved solution quality. Results confirm the effi-
ciency of QTIS in scheduling tasks with fixed temporal windows while minimizing conflicts, demon-
strating its potential to advance hybrid quantum–classical optimization in complex scheduling envi-
ronments.

Introduction
Task scheduling is a fundamental optimization problem
with applications in multiple real-world domains such as
industry [1, 2], logistics and transportation [3], computa-
tion [4, 5], or healthcare [6, 7], among others.
Task scheduling has traditionally been modeled with the
classical Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) [8, 9] or the
Job Shop Problem (JSP) [10] with the objective of de-
termining the optimal sequence and assignment of tasks
to resources to satisfy predetermined objectives, such
as minimizing cost, maximizing throughput, or ensuring
timely completion [11].
These problems belong to the class of NP-hard combina-
torial optimization problems [12] and, as noted by Gra-
ham et al. [13], finding a guaranteed optimal solution be-
comes computationally intractable as the problem size in-
creases.
This inherent complexity necessitates the use

Quantum Time Interval Scheduler
of approximation methods, such as heuristics [14, 15]
and meta-heuristics [16–19], for solving real-world, large-
scale instances in a reasonable time frame.
Although classical algorithms can accelerate the search
for solutions, optimization problems may also benefit
from advanced computing paradigms, particularly quan-
tum computing, which offers promising approaches for
managing complex scenarios in high-concurrency envi-
ronments [20, 21] .
In this sense, Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) [22,
23] is a paradigm particularly suited to tackling combi-
natorial optimization problems [24, 25]. In AQC, the op-
timization problem is encoded into a Hamiltonian whose
ground state corresponds to the optimal solution. The sys-
tem is initially prepared in the ground state of a simple
Hamiltonian and then evolved slowly enough—according
to the adiabatic theorem—to the ground state of the prob-
lem Hamiltonian. [26].
In addition to adiabatic quantum computing,
other
paradigms of quantum computation, such as gate-based
quantum computing, have proven effective in address-
ing combinatorial optimization problems [27–29] . These
universal quantum computing systems operate by execut-
ing quantum circuits composed of gates that implement
unitary operators on a set of qubits. The coherent and
controlled manipulation of qubits enables the implemen-
tation of quantum algorithms capable of surpassing clas-
sical methods in certain optimization contexts [21, 30].
Despite the theoretical promise of quantum advantage,
the practical deployment of quantum algorithms for real-
world applications is currently constrained by the limi-
tations of available hardware in the Noise-Intermediate-
Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices [31, 32].
These sys-
tems are highly sensitive to noise, still suffer from short
decoherence times, and are limited in the number of
qubits and the depth of circuits they can reliably exe-
cute.
Consequently, their inherent limitations prevent
them from independently solving large-scale optimization
problems, thereby motivating the development of hybrid
classical–quantum approaches [33, 34].
These hybrid approaches, that combine quantum algo-
rithms with classical computational resources, exploit the
strengths of both paradigms and have demonstrated clear
advantages over purely classical approaches. In particu-
lar, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have become
leading candidates for optimization tasks in the NISQ
era [35]. These hybrid methods rely on parameterized
quantum circuits to generate candidate solutions, while a
classical optimizer iteratively updates the parameters to
minimize a predefined cost function. Through this feed-
back loop, the quantum–classical system progressively
steers the circuit toward an approximation of the prob-
lem’s optimal solution.
Two of the most widely studied variational algorithms
are the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) [30]
and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA) [21, 36].
The VQE algorithm is designed to determine the low-
est eigenvalue and corresponding eigenstate of a system’s
Hamiltonian. Originally developed for quantum chem-
istry and materials science [37, 38]–where a molecule’s or
material’s ground state governs its properties–, VQE has
since been extended to continuous optimization, graph-
theoretic problems, and various industrial applications.
The method relies on the variational principle of quan-
tum mechanics, which guarantees that the expectation
value of a Hamiltonian for any trial state (ansatz)–C =
⟨Ψ(s)|H|Ψ(s)⟩– provides an upper bound to the true
ground-state energy.
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
[21] is a leading variational algorithm designed for com-
binatorial optimization problems, such as MaxCut, TSP,
VRP, and Job-Shop Scheduling. It approximates the op-
timal solution by emulating adiabatic evolution through a
discrete sequence of unitary operators constructed from a
problem Hamiltonian HP and a mixer Hamiltonian HB,
parameterized by angles γ and β. A classical optimizer
iteratively updates these parameters to minimize the ex-
pected energy, guiding the system toward the ground-state
configuration of HP , which encodes the desired solu-
tion. Various QAOA variants have been proposed to en-
hance performance, scalability, and applicability, includ-
ing Multi-angle QAOA [39], XQAOA [40], QAOA+ [41],
Two-Step QAOA [42], and the Quantum Alternating Op-
erator Ansatz [43].
In this work, we propose a novel version of the QAOA
algorithm designed to address a particular case of task
scheduling characterized by strict time restrictions for
both start times and durations.
Formally, the problem is defined as follows:
Given a set of tasks with predefined durations and start
times, along with a limited set of resources capable of run-
ning only one task at a time, the objective is to allocate the
maximum number of tasks while avoiding conflicts.
An example of the problem is illustrated in Fig. 1. A set
of eight tasks (T1 . . . T9), each with different start times
and durations, must be scheduled using three resources
(R1, R2, R3). The feasibility of the schedule depends on
the resource assignment: in Schedule A, all tasks are suc-
cessfully executed, whereas in Schedule B, some tasks
cannot be completed.
This scheduling problem, involving fixed time intervals
and limited resources, appears in many practical con-
texts.
Examples include industrial maintenance, just-
in-time production, aircraft take-off and landing, pub-
lic transport, computing clusters, cloud job allocation,
and surgical procedure scheduling.
In all cases, tasks
must be assigned to resources within predefined time
windows while respecting capacity constraints. Efficient
scheduling is essential to optimize resource utilization

Figure 1: Task scheduling problem with start time and

for the eight tasks, Schedule B with no allocated T4 task
and minimize delays or downtime. The diverse range of
these applications demonstrates the prevalence of time-
constrained scheduling problems and motivates the explo-
ration of quantum computing approaches to achieve more
effective optimization.
To address this scheduling problem, we formulate it as
a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
problem, encoding time and resource constraints into a
cost function whose feasible solutions represent approxi-
mately optimal task allocations.
Unlike traditional QAOA, our approach introduces an
ancilla-assisted quantum circuit that explicitly handles
task collisions and transfers them into the ansatz. In this
case, the ansatz involves dividing the problem’s Hamil-
tonian into two different Hamiltonians. The first is dedi-
cated to coding the problem and assigning it to resources,
and the second is in charge of handling the constraint that
two tasks cannot be executed simultaneously on the same
resource.
The main contributions of this work are summarized bel-
low:
First, the task scheduling problem with strict temporal
constraints is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, allowing its repre-
sentation within a quantum optimization framework. Sec-
ond, a quantum circuit for time-collision detection is de-
fined, incorporating two alternative schemes tailored to
different scheduling contexts. Third, a novel variant of the
standard Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA), referred to as Quantum Time Interval Sched-
uler QAOA (QTIS-QAOA), is proposed. This formulation
introduces three Hamiltonians, Hp, Hc, and HB, where
Hp encodes the optimization objective, Hc enforces the
time-collision constraints, and HB represents the stan-
dard mixer Hamiltonian. Furthermore, it is demonstrated
that the ansatz circuit can be constructed using elements
derived from an ancillary quantum subcircuit, effectively
embedding constraint information within the variational
form. It is also shown that employing a distinct parameter
set for the Hc Hamiltonian, rather than sharing the same
γi parameters applied to Hp, enhances the optimization
performance of the QTIS-QAOA algorithm.
Finally, a
parameter initialization method for the ansatz circuit,HT-
QAOA, is introduced, enabling higher solution accuracy
without significantly increasing computational cost.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 provides a background on QAOA and related work.
Section 3 presents the problem formulation and its trans-
formation into a QUBO model. Section 4 describes the
principles of the modified QAOA algorithm. Section 5
illustrates the role of the auxiliary quantum circuit in en-
forcing constraints. Section 6 discusses experimental re-
sults and performance analysis. Finally, Section 7 con-
cludes with key insights and directions for future research.

Background and related work
2.1
QAOA
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the adi-
abatic theorem [44]. It is grounded in the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation, which governs the temporal evolu-
tion of a quantum system’s state under a Hamiltonian such
that:
iℏ∂
∂t |Ψ(t)⟩= ˆH(t) |Ψ(t)⟩
(1)
If H(t) is time independent, the solution of equation 1
takes the form:
|Ψ(t)⟩=
X
n
cn(0)ei En(0)
ℏ
t |n(0)⟩
(2)
where En(0) and |n(0)⟩are the eigenvalues and eigenvec-
tors of the initial Hamiltonian defined by Eq. 3.
ˆH(0) |Ψ(0)⟩= En(0) |n(0)⟩
(3)
The adiabatic theorem states that, when the evolution of
H(t) is sufficiently slow, if the system is initially in the
ground state |Ψ(0)⟩, then at time T, for large enough T,
the system will stay in the new ground state |Ψ(T)⟩, char-
acterized by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the final
Hamiltonian ˆH(T):

This statement allows for the construction of an interpo-
lating Hamiltonian of the form H(s) = (1−s)HB+sHP ,
with s = t
T , where HB is an initial base Hamiltonian and
HP is a problem-dependent Hamiltonian. The adiabatic
evolution of the system drives it toward a final ground
state encoding the solution to the optimization problem.
QAOA leverages the adiabatic theorem to approximate the
solution of an optimization problem by defining two uni-
tary operators based on the Hamiltonians HP and HB,
parameterized by the angles γ and β:
U(HP , γ) = e−iγHP
(5)
U(HB, β) = e−iβHB
(6)
The Hamiltonian of the problem HP is constructed from
the optimization objective function, which is typically
formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Opti-
mization (QUBO) problem and then mapped to the Ising
model. In contrast, HB is a fixed mixing Hamiltonian,
expressed as:
HB =
n
X
j=1
σx
j
(7)
The QAOA algorithm builds the ansatz by alternating
applications of operators U(HP , γi) and U(HB, βi), re-
peated L times, as shown in Fig. 2.
Before applying the operators, the initial quantum state
|Ψ(0)⟩= |+⟩is prepared by applying a Hadamard gate to
each qubit in the register.
Once the quantum circuit is constructed, a classical op-
timization algorithm is employed to iteratively adjust the
set of parameters {γi, βi} in order to minimize the expec-
tation value:
⟨γ, β| HP |γ, β⟩
(8)
where:
|γ, β⟩=U(HB, βL)U(HP , γL) . . .
U(HB, βL)U(HP , γ1) |s⟩
(9)
and the initial state |s⟩is defined as:
|s⟩= |+1⟩. . . |+n⟩
(10)
2.1.1
⃗γ and ⃗β initialization
The proper initialization of the parameters ⃗γ and ⃗β is cru-
cial for the rapid convergence of the classical optimiza-
tion algorithm. An appropriate choice of these parame-
ters can significantly reduce the associated computational
complexity.
Numerous studies [45–48] have proposed different strate-
gies for the initial parameter selection. The simplest ap-
proach consists of choosing ⃗γ randomly within the range
[0, 2π], and ⃗β within [0, π].
More sophisticated meth-
ods rely on heuristic interpolation techniques to estimate
the initial parameters for a circuit of greater depth based
on the optimization results from a shallower circuit with
depth L = 1 or 2 [45]. For specific cases such as Max-
Cut, strategies based on neural networks have been pro-
posed [46], which can approximate the final parameters
with high accuracy, effectively eliminating the need for a
classical optimization loop.

The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA) was originally proposed to solve the MaxCut
problem, an NP-hard combinatorial optimization prob-
lem. Given a graph G = (V, E), the goal of MaxCut is to
partition the set of vertices V into two disjoint subsets S
and S, such that V = S ∪S, in a way that maximizes the
number of edges between elements in S and those in S.
Beyond MaxCut, QAOA has been explored as a heuris-
tic for other optimization problems classified as NP-Hard,
such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) [49] or
Graph partitioning [50] and colouring [51] among others.
In the context of task scheduling, the application of the
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to solve
the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) has proven to
be highly effective in domains such as logistics [52] or
manufacturing scenarios [28].
The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (illustrated in Fig. 3)
involves assigning a set of jobs J = {J1, J2, . . . , Jn}
with different processing times to a set of machines M =
{M1, . . . , Mk} with varying processing capacities, with
the objective of minimizing the total processing time.
Some variants of the JSSP include job dependencies or
machines specialized in certain types of tasks [52].

In other areas, the task scheduling problem needs to take
into account temporal constraints such as deadlines or
time execution windows. In this context, Khalid et al. [53]
propose the use of QAOA to address a task scheduling
problem for 6G networks in the cloud radio access net-
work.
In their formulation, tasks are processed at the
Remote Radio Heads, each with an associated execution
deadline. Temporal constraints are also particularly crit-
ical in deep space applications.
As noted by Geda et
al. [54], QAOA can be applied to schedule satellite imag-
ing tasks, ensuring that areas of the Earth are imaged
within the bounded time windows when the satellite is in
orbit over them.

Problem formulation
Our problem involves scheduling the execution of a series
of tasks with a limited set of resources, considering the
following rules:
1. Each task has a fixed execution duration and a
predefined time window, determined by a start
time and an end time (tend = tstart+duration),
which cannot be arbitrarily modified.
2. The available execution resources are finite, and
each resource can execute only one task at any
given time.
3. Some tasks may overlap in time, preventing them
from being executed on the same resource simul-
taneously.
With these premises, the goal is to maximize the number
of tasks that can be executed with the available set of re-
sources.
3.1
QUBO
To translate this problem into a QUBO formulation, we
will define a set of binary variables xij where:
xij =
1
if task i is scheduled in resource j
0
otherwise
(11)
With this definition, our goal is equivalent to minimizing
the function (12) with a set of constraints.
f(x) = −

(12)
The first constraint corresponds to the fact that tasks can
only be scheduled once in one of the available resources.

The second constraint avoids scheduling two overlapped
tasks on the same resource. That is,

∀i, j, k > i
(14)
where the overlap coefficient cik can be defined as :
cik =
1
if task i and k are overlapped
0
otherwise
(15)

QTIS-QAOA
In continuation of the formulation presented in Section 3,
this section introduces QTIS (Quantum Time Interval
Scheduler), a modified version of the standard QAOA
algorithm designed to address the corresponding task
scheduling problem.
As outlined in the theoretical background, QAOA oper-
ates by alternating two parameterized unitary operators,
U(HP , γi) and U(HB, βi), derived from the problem
Hamiltonian HP and the mixer Hamiltonian HB, respec-
tively, over a circuit of depth L. At each layer, a distinct
pair of parameters (γi, βi) is optimized through a classical
routine to minimize the expected value of the cost Hamil-
tonian.
The problem Hamiltonian HP can be obtained by trans-
forming the QUBO formulation of the scheduling prob-
lem into its equivalent Ising representation, while HB re-
mains fixed and corresponds to the definition provided in
equation (7).
The construction of the U(HP , γi) ansatz requires com-
plete pre-computation of the corresponding Ising Hamil-
tonian, which prevents the inclusion of elements that
could otherwise be computed dynamically within the
quantum circuit.
To overcome this limitation, the proposed QTIS-QAOA
introduces an extended formulation in which HP is parti-
tioned into two components, Hp and Hc, as follows:
HP = Hp + Hc
(18)
In this formulation, Hp is derived from the objective func-
tion together with a subset of the penalty terms, while Hc
encapsulates the remaining penalties. The application of
these latter terms is controlled by ancillary qubits gen-
erated through a complementary quantum circuit, as dis-
cussed in the following sections.
Under this decomposition, the operator U(HP , γi) is cor-
respondingly divided into two operators U(Hp, γi) and
U(Hc, ζi). Each parameterized with different angles γ
and ζ, respectively. The resulting QTIS-QAOA ansatz is
then composed of a sequence of L layers alternating the
three operators U(Hp, γi), U(Hc, ζi), and U(HB, βi) as
illustrated in Fig. 4.
4.1
Hp
Hp and Hc can be obtained by dividing the QUBO func-
tion (16) representing our problem into two parts. The
first part, corresponding to the Hp Hamiltonian, includes
the objective function (12) and the first set of penal-
ties (13) related to the constraint that tasks can only be
scheduled once in one of the available resources. That is,
QUBOHp = −
X
i

xij +

The transformation of QUBOHp into the Ising model
gives us the final expression of Hp, which takes the form:
Hp =

Jnnsn
(20)
The Hp Hamiltonian can then be used to define the oper-
ator U(Hp, γi) as:
U(Hp, γi) = e−iγiHp
(21)
This formulation of U(Hp, γi) allows us to realize the op-
erator as an ansatz circuit, composed of a set of quantum
gates Rzz and Rz which are parametrized by γi and the
coefficients Jnm, Jnn.
RZnZm(2γlJnm)⊗nm ⊗RZn(2γlJnn)⊗n
(22)
4.2
Hc
The Hamiltonian Hc is derived from the second set of con-
straints (14), which correspond to the remaining penalty
terms in the original QUBO formulation (16). These con-
straints are designed to prevent tasks from conflicting by
occupying the same resource simultaneously.
QUBOHc =
X

P(xij ∗xkj ∗cik)2

The Hc Hamiltonian can be computed, as shown in Ap-
pendix A, by applying the Ising transformation1 to the

of Hc is given by:
Hc =

Similarly to how we proceeded with Hp, the operator
U(Hc, ζi) can be obtained as:

The ansatz circuit for U(Hc, ζi) can be constructed with a
set of Rzz and Rz gates, following the same method used
for U(Hp, γi), as follows:
RZijZkj(2ζi
P
4 cik)⊗ikj⊗
RZij(−2ζi
P

(26)
This approach typically requires the overlap coefficients
cik to be precomputed before constructing the ansatz cir-
cuit. However, instead of doing so, we aim to compute the
coefficients as part of the quantum circuit itself.
To achieve this, we can take into account that the overlap
coefficients act as a control mechanism for the rotations
applied by the Rzz and Rz gates. Specifically, if tasks i
and k are in conflict, then cik = 1, and the corresponding
penalty rotations are applied. Conversely, if there is no
conflict (cik = 0), no rotation is applied.
This behavior allows us to replace the Rzz and Rz gates
with their controlled counterparts, CRzz and CRz respec-
tively. These gates are controlled by a set of qubits that
represent the coefficients cik, as shown in the following
expression.

ent versions applicable to different scenarios.

HB ansatz
The HB ansatz corresponding to the standard operator
U(HB, βi) defined in equation 6 consists on a single set
of RX gates applied to all the qubits representing the xij
variables, that is:
RXij(2βi)⊗ij
(28)

Conflict Detection
As we mentioned in the previous section, the overlapping
coefficients cik will be included within the QTIS-QAOA
ansatz as a set of ancillary qubits that controls the applica-
tion of the constraint penalties encoded in the Hc Hamil-
tonian.
In this work, we propose two different strategies for en-
coding the overlap information in the control qubits. The
7


Quantum Time Interval Scheduler
first approach—Full Quantum—estimates task overlaps
using a quantum circuit, which requires only minimal
classical pre-processing to normalize the time intervals
that define each task.
In contrast, the second approach—Classical—relies on a
classical algorithm to perform most of the computations
before translating the results into the quantum circuit. Al-
though this method incurs a higher classical computa-
tional cost, it typically requires fewer qubits and delivers
greater accuracy than the Quantum method in most sce-
narios.
5.1
Full Quantum variant for conflict detection
The quantum variant of the circuit is defined on the basis
of the following method to determine whether two tasks
overlap in time.
Consider two tasks, T i and T k, associated with the time
intervals [ti
s, ti
e] and [tk
s, tk
e], where ti
s, tk
s denote the start
times and ti
e, tk
e denote the end times. The tasks are said
to overlap if the end of task i is greater than the start of
task k and the end of task k is greater than the start of task
i, that is:
ti
e > tk
s ∧tk
e > ti
s
(29)
Based on this condition, we can determine the overlap co-
efficients cik as follows:
cik =
1
ti
e −tk
s > 0 ∧tk
e −ti
s > 0
0
otherwise
(30)
Using this definition, we construct a quantum circuit with
one qubit qt per task t, and an ancillary qubit qcik for each
overlap coefficient cik. The state |qcik⟩= |1⟩indicates
that tasks i and k overlap, while the state |0⟩represents
the absence of overlap.
The qubits qi,qk will be used to compute the probabilities
of ti
e −tk
s > 0 and tk
e −ti
s > 0. For that, we begin by
applying a Hadamard gate to each qi qubit to prepare them
in the superposition state |+⟩.
From this point, the differences ti
e−tk
s, tk
e −ti
s are mapped
as rotations around the Y-axis applied to qubits i and k,
respectively.
|i⟩= RY (2(ti
e −tk
s)) |+⟩
|k⟩= RY (2(tk
e −ti
s)) |+⟩
(31)
The operation defined in the previous equation can be de-
composed into a sequence of gates, starting with the appli-
cation of the rotations RY (−2ti
s) and RY (−2tk
s) to qubits
i, k, respectively. This is followed by a SWAP gate be-
tween the two qubits, and finally by the application of
RY (2ti
e), RY (2tk
e) rotation to the same qubits. This se-
quence is shown in Fig. 5

(32)
This computation requires that the interval times ti
s, ti
e ∀i
be scaled in the range [0, π/2]. In Fig. 7 we can see how
the physical interpretation of these operations is directly
related to the probabilities that qi, qk be in state |0⟩, ti
e −
tk
s < 0 and tk
e −ti
s < 0, or in state |1⟩, ti
e −tk
s > 0 and
tk
e −ti
s > 0.
Subsequently, the ancillary qubit qcik, representing the
overlap between i and k, is computed using a Toffoli (CC-
NOT) gate controlled by qi and qk, effectively implement-
ing a logical AND between the two.
|cik⟩= CCNOT(|i⟩⊗|k⟩)
(33)
5.2
Reduction of circuit complexity
The number of qubits required to compute the overlap co-
efficients for the N tasks can be reduced to:
Nqubits = N + N(N −1)
2
(34)
This can be achieved by computing the coefficients in
a sequential process.
In each step, we calculate one
of the coefficients ci,k and, after applying the CCNOT
gate, reverse the operation RY (2ti
e) ⊗RY (2tk
e) by ap-
plying RY rotations in the opposite direction to qubits
i and k.
In the next step, we apply the SWAP gate
again to the pair of qubits involved in the computation
of the next coefficient ci′k′ and perform the correspond-
ing rotations RY (2ti′
e ) ⊗RY (2tk′
e ) before applying the
CCNOT(|i′⟩⊗|k′⟩) gate. This iterative process contin-
ues until all coefficients have been calculated.
For practical purposes, we can define a custom gate for
the transformation:
D =[RY (−2ti
e) ⊗RY (−2tk
e)]⊗
CCNOT(
il
⊗
kl
)⊗
[RY (2ti
e) ⊗RY (2tk
e)]
(35)
With this structure, which we call the Damselfly gate, we
can compute collision probabilities for all tasks by com-
bining SWAP gates and Damselfly gates in a sequence of
stages.

Figure 6 shows an example circuit for three tasks, in
which the overlap coefficients are computed in three se-
quential gate stages, and where:
• q[0], q[1], q[2] represent tasks 0, 1, and 2, respec-
tively.
• qc[0] represents the overlap between tasks 0 and
1, c0,1.
• qc[1] represents c0,2.
• qc[2] represents c1,2.
5.2.1
Limitations
The presented approach can exhibit limitations in certain
cases due to the probabilistic nature of quantum measure-
ment outcomes.
The method is only suitable for interval sets where the
differences ti
e −tk
s and tk
e −ti
s are sufficiently large to
ensure that the coefficient cik can be measured with a clear
probability corresponding to either the |1⟩or |0⟩state.
If this is not the case, the calculation of the initial ro-
tations, as well as those performed within the damselfly
gates, would not be achievable through a simple scaling
of the time intervals within the range [0, 2π]. Instead, they
would need to be specifically calculated for each step. Ad-
ditionally, in such scenarios, the damselfly gates would
lose their antisymmetric property, increasing the amount
of classical pre-processing required and raising the classi-
cal computational cost.
5.3
Classical variant for conflict detection
The classical variant of the circuit for computing the over-
lap coefficients qubits is based on a different algorithm
from the one used in the quantum variant. This approach
is particularly suitable in scenarios where the quantum im-
plementation cannot be applied due to the limitations dis-
cussed in the previous section.
In this case, the classical approach begins with a list of
tasks that are pre-sorted by their start times. Given this
ordered list, we can efficiently verify whether two tasks
T i = [ti
s, ti
e] and T k = [tk
s, tk
e], where tk
s ≥ti
s, overlap by
checking the following condition:
tk
s −ti
e < 0
(36)
Using this method, we can define a quantum circuit that
requires a total number of qubits equal to:
nqubits = N(N −1)
2
,
N = number of tasks
(37)
where each qubit qcik represents a pairwise interval com-
parison.
The computation of each overlap coefficient cik begins
by applying a Hadamard gate to place the qubit in su-
perposition, followed by an RY rotation with an angle of
−π
2 ·sign(tk
s −ti
e). This rotation encodes whether the time
difference between the start of task k and the end of task
i is positive or negative, enabling the qubit to probabilis-
tically reflect the overlap condition.

5.4
QTIS ansatz implementation
With all elements already defined, we can now construct
the complete QTIS ansatz by taking the Kronecker prod-
uct of the QTIS-QAOA circuit and one of the collision
circuits, along with the connections between the ancillary
qubits qcik and the controlled gates Rz and Rzz within
the Hc layers of the QTIS-QAOA ansatz.
Fig. 10 shows an example circuit for a three-task schedul-
ing problem with a QAOA depth of L = 1, for both quan-
tum and classical variants of the conflict circuit. In the di-
agrams, we can also observe that measurement gates have
been added to both the qcik qubits and to the qubits in-
volved in the QTIS-QAOA circuit.
6
Simulations and results
To validate the QTIS algorithm, we conducted a series of
tests with a dual objective:
1. Identify a suitable minimization strategy for the
QTIS-QAOA ansatz that is capable of finding
a valid task allocation among the available re-
sources.
2. Determine whether introducing a third parame-
ter set, ⃗ζ, specifically for the Hc circuit (instead
of sharing the ⃗γ parameters with the Hp cir-
cuit), leads to an improvement in the minimiza-
tion process.
6.1
Test sets definition
To perform the tests, we define six sets of three tasks, each
with a different degree of overlap. The tasks in each set,
as shown in Table 1, are scheduled using two available
resources.
For each set of tasks, we perform batches of 10 sim-
ulations using the three different minimization strate-
gies defined in the next section:
standard QAOA, T-
QAOA[47], and HT-QAOA. For all strategies, we conduct
two batches: one with ⃗ζ = ⃗γ and another with ⃗ζ ̸= ⃗γ, to
evaluate which configuration best suits the problem de-
fined by the test set.
In all cases, the QTIS-QAOA ansatz is simulated with a
depth of L = 10 using the Qiskit Aer simulator and the
Qasm backend. The number of shots per simulation is
fixed at 100,000.

All these tests are initially performed using the classical
variant for the conflict detection circuit.
We will later
compare the results obtained for the first interval set with
those from the quantum variant of the conflict detection
circuit.
At the end of each simulation, we measure the normalized
energy of the solution:
Enorm = E(⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β, cik) −Emin
Emax −Emin
(39)
where
E(⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β, cik) =
D
⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β, cik|H|⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β, cik
E
(40)
Using the normalized energy as a reference allows us to
consistently compare the results across the different test
sets.
6.2
Minimization strategies
As mentioned above, the QTIS algorithm is a variant
of the QAOA algorithm and therefore requires a mini-
mization process to obtain optimal values for the param-
eters ⃗γ, ⃗ζl, and ⃗βl. The minimization process, along with
11


Quantum Time Interval Scheduler
the initial parameter selection, greatly influences both the
quality of the result and the computational complexity of
the algorithm’s execution. In this work, we evaluate three
different strategies: standard minimization, T-QAOA, and
HT-QAOA.
6.2.1
Standard minimization strategy
The standard minimization strategy consists of evaluating
the QTIS-QAOA circuit with the chosen depth of L = 10
iteratively. In each iteration, the parameters ⃗γ, ⃗ζl and ⃗βl
are adjusted using the COBYLA algorithm to minimize
the normalized energy of the expectation value:
D
⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β
 HP
⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β
E
(41)
where:
⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β
E
=U(HB, βL)U(Hc, ζL)U(Hp, γL) . . .
U(HB, β1)U(Hc, ζ1)U(Hp, γ1) |s⟩
(42)
|s⟩= |+1⟩. . . |+n⟩
(43)
The initial values of the parameters ⃗γ, ⃗ζl and ⃗βl in this
case are randomly assigned using a uniform distribution
function in the interval [0, π].
6.2.2
T-QAOA strategy
The T-QAOA strategy aims to obtain the parameters ⃗γ, ⃗ζ
and ⃗β for a given circuit depth L, using as a starting point
the parameters previously calculated for depth L −1.
In T-QAOA, we begin by applying a standard minimiza-
tion, defined above, with a depth of L = 1, and in succes-
sive stages, the standard minimization is reapplied while
incrementally increasing the circuit depth L, so that at
each stage L = l, the parameters ⃗γl, ⃗ζl, and ⃗βl are ini-
tialized as follows:
⃗γl
1..l−1 = ⃗γl−1

1..l−1 = ⃗βl−1
1..l−1
⃗βl
l = 0
(46)
6.2.3
HT-QAOA strategy
The third minimization strategy, which we introduce in
this work, is referred to as HT-QAOA. This strategy is in-
fluenced by the principles of quantum annealing and ho-
motopy optimization described in [48].
According to these principles, we can reach a target
Hamiltonian starting from an auxiliary Hamiltonian by
gradually varying a parameter α as follows:
H = α · Hobj + (1 −α) · Hm
(47)
As α approaches 1, the influence of the auxiliary Hamil-
tonian diminishes while the contribution of the target
Hamiltonian increases.
QAOA draws inspiration from this principles by alternat-
ing between the problem Hamiltonian HP and the mixing
Hamiltonian HB, each parameterized by ⃗γ and ⃗β, respec-
tively. Through successive optimization stages, and as the
circuit depth increases, it is commonly observed that the
parameters ⃗β tends to approach zero, while ⃗γ converges
toward π.
Building on this idea, the proposed HT-QAOA strategy
consists of two steps:
1. Perform an initial standard minimization with
circuit depth L = 1.
2. Perform a second standard minimization with the
full circuit depth L so that the parameters ⃗γ, ⃗ζ,
and ⃗β are initialized using a linear interpolation
from the parameters obtained in the first step.
Specifically, γl and ζl are initialized within the
ranges [γ1, π] and [ζ1, π], respectively, while βl
is initialized within the range [β1, 0].
6.3
Results
As previously described, in order to compare the three
strategies, we conducted batches of ten simulations per
algorithm for each set of tasks, considering both cases:
⃗γ ̸= ⃗ζ and ⃗γ = ⃗ζ.
The simulations were carried out in a virtualized environ-
ment with the specifications indicated in table 2.

Table 4 presents the mean normalized energy obtained for
each simulation batch, as well as the overall mean en-
ergy achieved by each minimization strategy across all
task sets.
According to the mean values for the normalized energy
of each strategy, T-QAOA is the strategy that obtains the
best result with the lowest mean energy. Followed by HT-
QAOA and the standard minimization. This can be seen
in Fig. 12, where a graph is shown that compares the ex-
ecution batches of the three strategies for each set with
γ ̸= ζ.
In all cases, the strategy HT-QAOA sits between the stan-
dard and T-QAOA, even when T-QAOA is worse than the

With these data on execution time, to determine whether
it is worth using the T-QAOA strategy in a more complex
scenario, we could apply the standard strategy followed
by HT-QAOA and if the energy of HT-QAOA is smaller
we can try T-QAOA if we need a better result.
6.3.2
Comparison between γ ̸= ζ and γ = ζ
The mean normalized energy measured along the different
simulations with the three minimization strategies (indi-
cated in table 4) leads us to think that using three different
parameters set ⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β to characterized the Hamiltonians
Hp, Hc and Hm with ⃗γ ̸= ⃗ζ is a better option than us-

ing only two different parameters (⃗γ = ⃗ζ) if we want to
obtain the best results in the minimization process.
In Fig. 11 we can see in detail the difference between us-
ing two or three parameters in the T-QAOA strategy ap-
plied to the task set 1. In each step, the mean normalized
energy of the ten simulations that we have carried out with
the set is larger if we use two parameters than if we use
three.
Finally, in Appendix 2, we present box plots for each task
set that compare the normalized energy measurements ob-
tained in the different simulations for each strategy, both
for the case where ⃗γ ̸= ⃗ζ and where (⃗γ = ⃗ζ).
These diagrams clearly show that the median value of the
normalized energy is consistently lower when ⃗γ ̸= ⃗ζ,
across all strategies and task sets.

Conclusions
This article has addressed the task scheduling problem,
which belongs to the class of NP-hard combinatorial op-
timization problems. In most cases, these problems are
modeled as a subclass of the Job Shop Scheduling Prob-
lem (JSSP), whose objective is to execute all tasks in the
shortest possible time using limited resources. However,
this work has a slightly different objective: tasks are sub-
ject to strict temporal constraints and must be executed at
specific times. Therefore, the goal is not focused on mini-
mizing the total execution time but rather on fitting all the
tasks within the limited set of available resources.
To tackle this challenge, the problem has been formu-
lated as a QUBO model. A novel variant of the QAOA
algorithm has been proposed, which has been named
QTIS-QAOA. In order to construct the ansatz, three oper-
ators have been incorporated: U(Hp, γi), U(Hc, ζi), and
U(HB, βi), in contrast to the original QAOA, which re-
lies on only two operators, U(HP , γi) and U(HB, βi).
This extension is intended to allow the operator U(Hc, ζi)
to take into account elements computed in a new section
within the quantum circuit itself.
The Hamiltonians Hp and Hc can be considered a decom-
position of the general HP Hamiltonian obtained from the
QUBO model of the problem.
The operator U(Hc, ζi) encapsulates the section of the
QUBO that includes penalties for assigning two tasks
to the same resource at the same time. These penalties
depend on collision coefficients, cik. In our approach,
these cik coefficients are computed using a set of ancillary
qubits, with two proposed quantum circuits for different
scenarios. Subsequently, these qubits act as controls for
the application of penalty terms in the U(Hc, ζi) operator.
Computing the collision coefficient using a fully quantum
approach may result in a loss of accuracy in certain cases.
This is why a classical preprocessing alternative for de-
termining the coefficients is also proposed in case these
limitations are present.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposals, multiple
simulations have been carried out on six task sets, using
three different minimization strategies: Standard QAOA
and T-QAOA, and a novel one, HT-QAOA, which consti-
tutes an additional contribution of this work. HT-QAOA
initializes parameters ⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β by extrapolating from the re-
sults of an initial simulation with circuit depth L = 1, fol-
lowing principles from quantum annealing and homotopy
optimization.
Experimental results show that HT-QAOA achieves in-
termediate performance between standard QAOA and T-
QAOA. Nevertheless, it maintains an execution time com-
parable to that of the standard version. This behavior sug-
gests the potential to use low-depth for determining the
most suitable optimization strategy for a given instance
before scaling up.
The results also indicate that using
three distinct parameter sets—⃗γ, ⃗ζ, ⃗β—with ⃗γ ̸= ⃗ζ leads
to better quality solutions compared to using ⃗γ = ⃗ζ, al-
though at the cost of increased computational effort. Fu-
ture work will investigate scalability to larger task graphs
and alternative Hamiltonian decompositions to enhance
performance and generalization.
A
Ising
In this appendix we are going to calculate the Ising model
for the Hc Hamiltonian.
As we have seen, Hc are derived from the constraints
xijxkjcik = 0
∀i, j, k > i, which establish that tasks
cannot be executed simultaneously on the same resource.
The QUBO penalties corresponding to these constraints
are in the formula:
QUBOHc =
X
j
X
k
X
i
P(xijxkjcik)2
(48)
To calculate the Ising model, we have to apply the QUBO
to Ising transformation: xij = (1−sij)
2
, xkj = (1−skj)
2
If we focus on the quadratic term, we can see that:

(xijxkjcik)2 =(1 −sij

ik
= 1
42 (1 −sij −skj + sijskj)2cik
= 1
42 (1 −sij −skj + sijskj
−sij + sijsij + sij ∗skj −sijsijskj
−skj + skjsij + skjskj −sijskjskj
+ sijskj −sijsijskj −skjsijskj
+ sijskjsijskj)cik
= 1
42 (1 −sij −skj + sijskj
−sij + 1 + sijskj −skj
−skj + skjsij + 1 −sij
+ sijskj −skj −sij + 1)cik
= 1
42 (4 −4sij −4skj + 4sijskj)cik
=1
4(1 −sij −skj + sijskj)cik
(49)
So, if we substitute the previous results into QUBOHc ex-
pression, we can obtain the final Ising model for the Hc
Hamiltonian as:
Hc =
X
j

k
X
i
P
4 (1 −sij −skj + sijskj)cik

ergy values obtained over 10 simulations for each task
set and each minimization strategy–under both configu-
rations ⃗γ ̸= ⃗ζ and (⃗γ = ⃗ζ)–are presented in Figure 13.
