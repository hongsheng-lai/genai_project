Abstract. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks enable unconditionally 
secure key exchange using quantum mechanical principles; however, routing 
cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges 
unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 
routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and 
hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been 
shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25–40% compared to static shortest-
path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. 
Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by 
distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key 
consumption of 30–60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as 
essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating 
terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links. Critical research directions 
include reducing dependence on trusted nodes through quantum repeaters or 
post-quantum cryptography, developing standardized key management 
interfaces for interoperability, and adopting AI-driven predictive routing for 
adapting to fluctuating network states. This comprehensive synthesis of routing 
algorithms, performance trade-offs, and unresolved issues offers practical 
guidance for engineering secure, adaptable, and large-scale QKD networks 
capable of meeting real-world deployment demands.

Introduction 
Quantum Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides a secure method for 
generating cryptographic keys, using quantum mechanical phenomena to ensure that 
any attempt at eavesdropping is detectable. Unlike classical key exchange protocols, 


2 
QKD ensures information-theoretic security, making it a critical enabler for future-
proof communications. With the development of terrestrial fiber-based and satellite-
based QKD systems, networked QKD infrastructures are becoming a reality, requiring 
efficient and secure routing of quantum keys. 
Classical public-key cryptosystems are under imminent threat from quantum 
computing, motivating the development of QKD as a means to distribute encryption 
keys with unconditional security. QKD leverages quantum mechanics (e.g., Fock states 
or coherent states) to generate shared random keys between two parties such that any 
eavesdropping on the quantum channel is detectable by increased error rates [1]. Over 
a point-to-point link, QKD can produce symmetric keys that are proven secure against 
even quantum adversaries. However, practical QKD links face severe distance 
limitations (on the order of tens to a few hundred kilometers in fiber) due to signal loss 
and detector noise. This necessitates QKD networks that connect multiple QKD links, 
enabling key exchange over long distances and among many users. 
The most mature approach for extending QKD range is to use trusted 
intermediate nodes, where each fiber or free-space QKD link terminates at a node that 
performs key relay (by XOR-combining keys from adjacent links) to forward secret 
keys across the network. Trusted-node QKD networks have been demonstrated on city 
and national scales. For example, the Tokyo QKD network (2010) with 10 nodes [2] 
and the SECOQC Vienna network (2008) with 6 nodes [3] were early metropolitan 
QKD networks. More recently, a 46-node quantum metropolitan area network was 
implemented in China [4]. Going beyond terrestrial fiber, QKD-capable satellites in 
low Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit (GEO) have been used to establish 
intercontinental quantum links, culminating in an integrated space-to-ground QKD 
network spanning 4,600 km demonstrated in China [5]. These advances herald the 
dawn of global QKD networks that seamlessly blend terrestrial and satellite channels. 
In parallel with this experimental progress, significant research attention has 
turned to the network-layer problem of routing keys in QKD networks—determining 
how keys should be relayed or shared across multiple hops to efficiently and securely 
reach their destinations. Unlike classical data routing, QKD key routing has unique 
challenges. First, QKD links continuously generate secret bits at a finite key generation 
rate that depends on channel loss and protocol efficiency. These keys are a consumable 
resource: if a path’s intermediate node runs out of fresh key material, further secret 
communication on that path is blocked until more keys are generated. This makes key 
availability a critical factor in routing decisions. 
Second, every additional hop (trusted relay) in a route introduces a potential 
security vulnerability—if an adversary compromises a trusted node, any keys passing 
through that node could be exposed. Routing strategies thus directly affect the threat 
model: a shorter route with fewer hops is generally more secure (fewer points of attack) 
but might suffer higher loss on a single long link, whereas multi-hop routes can achieve 
longer reach at the cost of trusting more nodes. Third, QKD networks often operate 
alongside classical networks, requiring hybrid routing approaches where a classical 
control plane (for signaling and key management) coordinates the usage of quantum 
channels. Issues such as network topology changes, node failures, and varying channel 


3 
conditions (especially in free-space/satellite links subject to weather and orbital 
dynamics) demand dynamic routing algorithms beyond static paths. 
The primary focus of this research is to survey how optimal routes for key 
exchange in QKD networks can be determined, accounting for the above challenges. 
We cover the full spectrum of QKD network scenarios: (i) terrestrial QKD networks 
using optical fiber or line-of-sight free-space links with trusted repeater nodes; (ii) 
satellite QKD networks where keys are delivered via satellites acting as transmitters or 
relays; and (iii) hybrid networks that integrate terrestrial and satellite QKD links into a 
unified architecture. We review both theoretical models that formulate routing as an 
optimization problem (often with multi-objective criteria like maximizing key rate 
while minimizing hops or cost), as well as experimental and simulation-based studies 
that demonstrate routing and key relay in real or emulated QKD network testbeds. 
Particular emphasis is placed on classical-quantum hybrid routing approaches—for 
instance, using software-defined networking (SDN) controllers to manage QKD 
resources, or combining QKD with post-quantum cryptography for resilience. We also 
examine the security implications of different routing strategies, evaluating how well 
they uphold end-to-end key secrecy under various threat models. The survey compares 
routing algorithms on multiple performance axes, including achievable key throughput 
(keys/sec delivered between end-users), latency (time to establish keys), network 
resource utilization, and deployment cost.

Previous research 
Numerous routing algorithms for QKD networks have been proposed, each 
addressing the inherent limitations of quantum communication links. Early approaches 
aimed to abstract the quantum layer and utilize classical routing strategies over a 
virtualized infrastructure, for example via SDN-enabled overlay techniques [7]. Other 
works investigated adaptive and dynamic routing schemes that account for key buffer 
status and real-time link availability. Kutzkov and Kiktenko introduced a multiple non-
overlapping paths routing algorithm to improve resilience in trusted-node networks by 
maintaining alternative disjoint routes [8]. This approach considers both key 
availability and link reliability (distributing secret keys across parallel paths to prevent 
single-point failure). Similarly, Lin et al. proposed reinforcement learning-based 
methods to dynamically select routes based on observed network behavior and key 
utilization patterns [9]. 
Routing in satellite-based QKD networks has gained traction with projects such 
as the European Space Agency’s INT-UQKD initiative [6], which explores integrating 
LEO satellites into a global QKD framework. These efforts highlight the need for path 
planning that accommodates orbital dynamics, variable weather conditions, and the 
limited time windows for satellite visibility. Hybrid QKD networks, combining 
terrestrial fiber links with satellite relays, require sophisticated algorithms to balance 
key distribution across very different media. For example, heuristic approaches have 
been introduced to optimize hybrid routing for minimal latency and sufficient key 
throughput (e.g., by prioritizing either fiber or satellite paths based on current network 


4 
conditions) [10]. The inclusion of quantum repeaters and memory-enabled nodes has 
also been considered in recent studies, which emphasize the impact of quantum 
memory decoherence on route selection and network performance (e.g., limiting the 
time keys can be stored before use). 
More recent contributions have highlighted the need to integrate SDN 
controllers to manage hybrid quantum-classical infrastructures. Such architectures 
support modular network configuration and monitoring, which is essential for dynamic 
environments like satellite networks with time-varying connectivity. However, most 
existing proposals remain limited to conceptual frameworks or small-scale simulations, 
lacking practical validation in real-world quantum networks. Furthermore, few 
approaches systematically incorporate both dynamic key availability and security 
constraints (e.g., the trust level of intermediate nodes) into unified routing decisions. 
This gap underscores the need for integrated routing solutions that combine real-time 
control, quantum-aware metrics, and scalable orchestration across diverse QKD 
technologies—a challenge we address by synthesizing and evaluating strategies from 
the literature under a unified framework.

Overview of QKD Network Characteristics 
QKD networks comprise nodes capable of generating, storing, and forwarding 
quantum keys. The physical layer may include optical fibers, free-space terrestrial links, 
or satellite-to-ground channels. Unlike classical data, quantum keys are generated 
probabilistically and may be exhausted after a limited number of uses, necessitating 
constant key renewal and intelligent routing mechanisms. Table 1 compares the typical 
parameters and constraints of three major QKD network scenarios: terrestrial, satellite, 
and hybrid.

As shown in Table 1, QKD network scenarios range from relatively static fiber-based 
infrastructures to highly dynamic satellite constellations. Correspondingly, a variety of 
routing and key management strategies have been proposed to optimize key exchange 
under these differing conditions. This survey synthesizes these diverse approaches into 
a unified overview. To the best of our knowledge, it is among the first to jointly address 
terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD network routing, supported by an extensive 
literature review spanning 2013–2024. In the following sections, we outline our 
methodology and then discuss routing strategies for each network type in detail.

Research methodology 
To classify and compare existing routing strategies, we conducted a structured 
literature review of peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, and major QKD 
deployment initiatives. The selected literature spans the period from foundational QKD 
networking experiments (e.g., the DARPA Quantum Network in the mid-2000s and 
SECOQC in 2008) to contemporary hybrid network designs employing SDN-based 
control and satellite integration. This research selection criteria included: 
• 
Relevance to QKD-specific constraints: e.g., key exhaustion, probabilistic key 
generation, trust management. 
• 
Applicability to trusted-node architectures: multi-hop key relay. 
• 
Consideration of physical-layer limitations: loss, noise, and topology dynamics. 
• 
Support for dynamic or adaptive routing mechanisms. 
• 
Experimental validation or realistic simulation. 
 
Each approach was analyzed along three dimensions: (1) Routing objective 
(throughput maximization, latency minimization, reliability enhancement, etc.), (2) 
Network type considered (terrestrial, free-space, satellite, or hybrid), and (3) 
Optimization strategy (static vs. dynamic, deterministic vs. probabilistic, heuristic vs. 
machine learning). We further assessed whether the solutions support integration with 
classical control protocols, SDN controllers, or centralized key management systems. 
This methodology facilitated the construction of a comparative framework 
summarizing the strengths, limitations, and gaps in current QKD routing proposals.

Analysis of QKD Routing Approaches 
5.1 
Terrestrial QKD Networks 
 
In fiber-based QKD networks, routing must contend with high attenuation over 
long distances. Trusted nodes extend the reach by storing and relaying keys between 
shorter fiber segments. Algorithms such as those proposed in research [20], use 


7 
dynamic path selection based on key buffer availability. Multi-path strategies, as in [8], 
enhance robustness by maintaining alternate disjoint routes to avoid single points of 
failure.

Terrestrial QKD networks, primarily relying on optical fiber infrastructure, are 
currently the most mature and widely deployed form of quantum key distribution. Their 
routing strategies, however, must address unique constraints arising from limited key 
generation rates, sensitivity to quantum bit error rate (QBER), and the necessity of 
trusting intermediate nodes. A critical limitation of terrestrial QKD links lies in their 
attenuation and noise characteristics, with secret key rates decreasing exponentially 
over distance due to fiber loss (~0.2 dB/km) and dark counts at detectors. As a result, 
trusted repeater nodes are introduced to extend reach, but every additional node 
introduces a potential compromise point, shifting routing optimization to a multi-
objective problem: minimize hops for trust, maximize key throughput, and avoid 
overloading individual links. 
Another unique aspect is the key resource constraint: QKD links produce a 
consumable key material. This resource constraint makes it essential for routing 
protocols to monitor the current state of key buffers and adapt accordingly to avoid 
service disruptions due to key depletion. 
Recent approaches extend classical shortest-path algorithms to account for quantum-
specific metrics. For example, in residual-key-aware routing, each edge weight is 
dynamically computed based on the availability of key material and the link’s expected 
QBER. 
In [14], authors model key generation and consumption using a Poisson process, 
calculating the blocking probability of each link and adjusting weights accordingly. 
This SDN-based dynamic routing strategy has been shown to significantly reduce 
service rejection and latency compared to static OSPF-based methods. 
To ensure route feasibility under limited key availability, links falling below a 
predefined key threshold can be excluded from the routing graph entirely, necessitating 
frequent state synchronization between nodes and SDN controllers or distributed agents 
[12]. This approach guarantees that selected paths meet minimum operational criteria 
for secure communication. The methodology has been further enhanced by integrating 
QBER thresholds directly into edge weights, thus preemptively avoiding high-error 
links that are likely to fail during key reconciliation [12].

As QKD networks are increasingly deployed in shared metro-area environments, 
support for multiple tenants and differentiated QoS requirements has become essential. 
For instance, real-time applications such as encrypted voice calls demand consistent 
key delivery, whereas bulk encrypted transfers can tolerate temporal fluctuations. To 
accommodate these needs, utility-based routing strategies have been proposed, wherein 
key bandwidth is allocated according to service-level agreements (SLAs) [16], [17]. 
These methods utilize SDN controllers to assign and enforce service priorities through 
routing and scheduling mechanisms. Consequently, high-priority sessions maintain 
uninterrupted access to key material, while lower-priority sessions may be deferred or 
rerouted during key scarcity. 
Such QoS-aware routing is facilitated by SDN-based key orchestration frameworks 
that virtually slice key resources among tenants. Policy-driven mechanisms define how 
and when each tenant can access the underlying quantum infrastructure, ensuring both 
fairness and efficiency in resource utilization. 
Load-balancing mechanisms can mitigate key exhaustion by distributing traffic 
across multiple paths. However, this increases coordination complexity. For example, 
Wang et al. suggested periodically recalculating optimal paths based on real-time key 
usage metrics. Routing decisions in terrestrial QKD networks must also consider fiber 
quality (loss), the availability of dark fibers, and the geographic distribution of trusted 
relay stations. Notably, the SECOQC Vienna QKD network implemented a dynamic 
routing protocol to handle variations in link conditions and key supply. 
5.2 
Satellite QKD Networks 
Satellite QKD introduces a unique set of constraints compared to terrestrial fiber-
based networks. Unlike stable terrestrial links, satellite links are highly time-dependent, 
intermittent, and asymmetric. This results in a routing and scheduling challenge rather 
than a straightforward pathfinding problem. 
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites exhibit periodic visibility windows with ground 
stations, producing a dynamic network topology best represented by time-expanded 
graphs, where each edge corresponds to a satellite-ground contact opportunity during a 
specific time slot. A topology abstraction method was introduced to construct a static 
logical layer that aggregates all feasible satellite-ground pairings over a given pass 
interval, allowing the application of classical routing algorithms such as Dijkstra or ILP 
for determining optimal contact sequences for key relaying [19].

Fig.1. Architecture integrating urban and terrestrial grid networks across LEO, MEO, 
and GEO orbits [10] 
 
In contrast, Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites provide near-continuous 
connectivity but suffer from significantly lower key rates due to increased optical 
losses. Thus, routing strategies in hybrid LEO-GEO networks must balance link 
availability, throughput, and latency. Example of the envisioned architecture 
integrating urban and terrestrial grid networks across LEO, MEO, and GEO orbits for 
DS-BB84 QKD downlinks under night-time conditions is shown on schematics in 
Figure 1. 
Satellite QKD requires solving the contact scheduling problem—determining which 
users or links are to be served during each satellite pass. An ILP framework has been 
proposed to maximize key delivery while adhering to constraints imposed by orbital 
dynamics and visibility windows [23]. To improve scalability, heuristic methods, 
including greedy and hybrid metaheuristic approaches like genetic algorithms, have 
been developed for resource allocation under service-level guarantees. 
Another critical design consideration is key storage. Due to the intermittent nature 
of satellite links, generated keys must be temporarily stored onboard and forwarded 
during subsequent contact opportunities. Therefore, buffer management strategies and 
time-slot reservation mechanisms are essential components of satellite QKD system 
design. Furthermore, environmental factors such as cloud cover, beam divergence, and 
atmospheric turbulence influence link availability and quality. Real-time environmental 
data integration and predictive weather modeling are increasingly being explored for 
adaptive satellite QKD routing. 
5.3 
Hybrid QKD Networks 
Hybrid QKD networks combine terrestrial and satellite components. Routing in such 
systems involves selecting among heterogeneous paths with different trust levels and 
performance profiles. For example, researchers showed a hybrid implementation that 


10 
dynamically switches between satellite and fiber links in a large-scale network, shown 
in Figure 2. [5].  
 
Fig.2. Visualization of integrated space-to-ground quantum network [5] 
 
Heuristic approaches have been proposed to minimize total latency while ensuring 
sufficient key material is available for end-users. Other studies consider the use of 
quantum repeaters and memory to temporarily store keys or entangled states, enabling 
delayed forwarding to match link availability (though practical quantum memory is 
currently very limited). In general, hybrid routing algorithms must balance trade-offs 
between performance (throughput, delay), trust (number of intermediaries), and cost. 
For instance, a routing decision might favor a longer terrestrial path over a satellite hop 
at certain times to avoid using scarce satellite resources or to maintain a higher security 
level, and vice versa during off-peak hours. 
5.4 
Routing Algorithms and Protocols 
Early routing strategies in QKD networks adapted classical algorithms like 
Dijkstra’s shortest path, with edge weights reflecting QKD-specific metrics such as key 
rate or trust level. A dynamic graph approach was proposed in which only links with 
available keys are considered during route computation [12]. It was also shown that 
standard protocols like OSPF, when applied without modification, can lead to the 
overuse and depletion of certain QKD links; to address this, probabilistic link-cost 
metrics based on key consumption rates—such as Poisson-based models for key 
exhaustion—were introduced to improve routing decisions [14]. Recent developments 
have focused on SDN-controlled dynamic routing approaches, wherein link weights are 
updated in real time based on current key buffer levels and predicted key lifetimes. For 
instance, adaptive link weighting and time-sensitive key stability models have been 
proposed to optimize path selection [13], [14], where process of key pool providing key 
encryption for data communication between two optical nodes can be seen in Figure 3.  


11 
 
Fig.3. Quantum key pool [13] 
Multi-path routing has been explored as a strategy to enhance robustness and 
confidentiality: one approach employed XOR-based schemes to distribute secret keys 
across disjoint paths, which reduces the risk from compromised trusted nodes at the 
cost of requiring multiple simultaneous key-distribution routes [8]. This concept was 
further developed for increased throughput using parallel fiber links in a metropolitan 
QKD deployment [15].

Quality-of-service (QoS)-aware routing is becoming increasingly relevant for multi-
tenant QKD infrastructures. One solution employed a utility-based optimization model 
that prioritizes key delivery for high-importance users in the context of limited key 
availability [16]. Another contribution implemented SDN slicing to support tenant-
isolated key provisioning in hybrid QKD networks, ensuring minimal interference 
across different user domains [17]. On the protocol development side, a dedicated link-
state routing protocol was created specifically for QKD environments under the 
SECOQC initiative [3], while integration of QKD metrics into legacy routing protocols 
like OSPF has been experimentally validated in real-world testbeds [18]. Centralized 
SDN-based controllers continue to be favored in experimental setups due to their 
capacity for global state awareness and advanced optimization capabilities. 
5.5 
Satellite, Hybrid, and Classical-Quantum Integration 
Satellite QKD routing requires temporal optimization due to the inherently time-
varying topology of orbital networks. One approach to addressing this challenge 
involves topology abstraction, which converts dynamic link states into quasi-static 
graphs, thereby simplifying routing decisions over orbital cycles [19]. Optimization 
methodologies, particularly those based on integer linear programming (ILP), have 
been employed to schedule key transmissions and allocate network resources 
efficiently. ILP-based models have been proposed for joint optimization of routing, 
channel assignment, and key rate allocation, demonstrating tangible benefits of global 
optimization when physical constraints are considered [20]. In parallel, the concept of 
hybrid QKD routing, which combines both satellite and terrestrial fiber segments, has 
gained traction. Software-defined networking (SDN) orchestration has been used to 
manage such hybrid topologies, enabling centralized control over mixed infrastructures 
[17], [21]. Adaptive routing strategies have been proposed for global-scale QKD 
deployments, integrating considerations such as channel loss and trust levels across 
fiber and satellite segments [22]. Importantly, the optimal routing strategy is not static 
but varies with environmental and operational conditions—for instance, satellites may 
be more effective during nighttime or clear weather, while fiber may be preferable in 
adverse conditions or when satellites are unavailable. SDN-enabled control planes 


13 
support real-time adaptability, making latency-aware QKD routing with dynamic key 
refresh mechanisms feasible in practice [18], [23]. Moreover, hybrid encryption 
schemes that combine QKD with post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) techniques are 
being actively explored. Such schemes ensure continuity of secure communication by 
using QKD-generated keys when available, and falling back to PQC when quantum 
channels are degraded [6], [24]. Recent trials and projects have started validating these 
architectures, which represent a promising direction for enhancing the robustness of 
secure communication infrastructures. 
In modern QKD networks, a centralized SDN controller (control layer) orchestrates 
both the quantum and classical resources. It maintains a global view of the network: 
querying each QKD link’s status (available key buffer, error rates) and each node’s 
classical switches or encryptors. The controller uses this information to schedule key 
generation and path setup for user requests. For example, it can reserve an optical circuit 
for data while ensuring sufficient QKD-generated keys are routed along that path. The 
SDN controller “sees” QKD devices as network elements that export their capabilities 
(without revealing secret keys), and can command them to start/stop key sessions or 
adjust rates. In effect, the SDN control plane unifies classical and quantum routing: it 
computes routes that optimize key throughput or latency based on real-time key-buffer 
metrics, then programs both the classical switches and the QKD hardware accordingly. 
It can also enact higher-level functions like traffic engineering or multi-tenancy: for 
instance, dynamically slicing the network so that each user’s key demands are isolated 
[30], [14]. 
Routing decision flow (example): When an application requests a key between 
nodes, the SDN controller follows a loop of sensing, planning, and acting. A typical 
sequence can be seen bellow: 
• 
Step 1: Key request & requirement. An application or user at node A requests 
a key of a certain length to node B. The requirement (e.g. length, deadline) is 
passed to the SDN controller. 
• 
Step 2: Metrics collection. The controller polls the network elements: it reads 
each link’s current key-buffer level and status (via a key-pool management 
interface), and checks classical link metrics (latency, availability) 
• 
Step 3: Path computation. Using these metrics, the controller computes the 
best route(s). For instance, it may run a weighted shortest-path algorithm 
where each edge weight penalizes links with low key availability or high 
latency. Links with insufficient stored keys are either avoided or assigned very 
high cost. Multi-path or XOR-routing may be employed to split keys across 
diverse routes for robustness. 
• 
Step 4: Route installation. The controller configures the network: it instructs 
the chosen QKD links to generate keys (perhaps boosting their rate) and 
programs classical switches to establish the data/management channels. In 
hybrid scenarios, it may allocate a satellite ground station or a fiber route as 
appropriate. 
• 
Step 5: Monitoring & feedback. As keys are consumed, the controller 
continuously monitors key-buffer levels. If a buffer drops below a threshold, 
this triggers a feedback loop: the controller can recompute routes or request 


14 
extra QKD generation on that link. For example, research [21] demonstrated 
an “adjustable key pool” mechanism where remaining key count is used to 
avoid routes that risk depletion. 
• 
Step 6: Failover (reconfiguration). If a link fails or a buffer is critically low, 
the controller immediately activates a failover: it diverts the key flow to pre-
computed backup paths (e.g. alternate fiber links or pending satellite passes). 
This might involve tearing down one path and instating another within 
milliseconds, or gradually shifting key traffic. The controller ensures that the 
end-to-end key service continues seamlessly despite link outages or 
depletions. 
The above loop illustrates how SDN provides both agility and reliability: by tightly 
coupling control software with network measurements, routing decisions can adapt in 
real-time to key-generation dynamics and link conditions. 
In hybrid fiber–satellite networks, the SDN controller handles even more complex 
scheduling. Satellite-based QKD links are intermittent and scheduled (known pass 
windows and weather constraints), whereas fiber links are relatively stable. The 
controller integrates these into its topology model. For example, it may reserve fiber 
key-buffer resources to “bridge the gap” between satellite passes, or it may schedule a 
ground station’s QKD system to run during a predicted clear-sky window. Using 
abstractions the controller treats each satellite pass as a time-extended link in the graph 
[19]. It can then compute routes that combine multiple fiber segments and satellite hops, 
trading off key rates and latency. If a satellite link becomes unavailable (e.g. passing 
out of visibility or due to clouds), the SDN feedback loop immediately re-routes keys 
via terrestrial paths until the next satellite opportunity. Hybrid demonstrators have 
shown that a centralized SDN controller can effectively coordinate such mixed 
topologies pre-loading keys on ground links before a satellite relay is activated, and 
switching over as needed [21]. In this way, SDN orchestration ensures end-to-end key 
delivery across fiber and free-space segments, leveraging the best of each while 
responding automatically to the network’s evolving state. 
5.6 
Trends and Open Challenges 
Despite significant progress, several challenges remain unresolved. First, most 
routing strategies rely on trusted-node assumptions, which limit end-to-end security 
guarantees. Future research must explore lightweight, scalable quantum repeater 
models or post-quantum–enhanced trust frameworks to reduce reliance on trusted 
intermediaries. Second, current algorithms often neglect fine-grained traffic 
engineering and load distribution between quantum and classical paths. Incorporating 
SDN-based orchestration with AI-driven traffic prediction remains an open avenue. 
Third, interoperability between heterogeneous QKD systems and vendor platforms is 
limited. The development of standardized control-plane interfaces and routing APIs 
(e.g., ITU-T Y.3800 framework) will be critical to achieve seamless integration and 
manageability in global QKD infrastructures. In sum, future work should combine 
robust routing algorithms, intelligent control mechanisms, and secure multi-domain 


15 
coordination to enable practical, scalable, and secure quantum key routing across 
hybrid communication infrastructures. 
As QKD networks expand beyond small testbeds into metro or national backbones, 
existing routing schemes struggle with scale and diversity. New routing algorithms 
must handle tens or hundreds of nodes, complex topologies (e.g. multi-domain links, 
mesh graphs) and devices with widely varying capabilities. For example, centralized 
schemes that recompute routes for each key request may quickly become infeasible as 
the network grows. Moreover, the lack of vendor, and protocol-neutral key-
management (KMS) interfaces (most current QKD modules use proprietary protocols) 
creates a major heterogeneity challenge. In practice, each vendor’s QKD module should 
interoperate under a common control logic; without standards, operators remain locked 
into specific hardware. Research has only begun to quantify these trade-offs: one study 
found that more complex, resource-aware routing can improve key distribution success 
rates but at the cost of much higher computational overhead [26]. To address these gaps, 
new distributed or hybrid routing architectures are needed that can scale (e.g. 
hierarchical or zone-based control), along with standardized, vendor-agnostic KMS 
interfaces. Simulation platforms will be essential for evaluating candidate algorithms 
before costly field deployment [27], [28], [29]. 
Integration with Classical and Post-Quantum Infrastructures. QKD cannot exist in 
isolation – it must interoperate with conventional and post-quantum security layers. In 
practice, this means designing hybrid encryption schemes and unified control planes 
that seamlessly combine QKD-derived keys with classical keying (PQC or public-key) 
and leverage existing network management technology. Recent demonstrations (such 
as the MadQCI deployment) explicitly mix QKD keys with standard public-key 
cryptography to achieve end-to-end security [30]. Such hybrid approaches require 
careful coordination: for example, integrating a QKD controller into an SDN-based 
optical or IP network so that key routing and data routing share a single control plane 
[31]. In this way, the SDN controller can manage both classical encryption devices and 
quantum channel resources jointly [14]. A major open challenge is designing 
middleware and orchestration layers that let QKD key pools be used interchangeably 
with post-quantum key agreement (e.g. as specified by ETSI/QKD group standards) 
without sacrificing performance. Industry white papers emphasize hybrid QKD+PQC 
transition schemes for critical infrastructure, but concrete network architectures are still 
sparse in the literature. 
In operational QKD networks, link conditions and key resources fluctuate 
constantly. Fiber QKD links can suffer outages or loss changes, and satellite QKD links 
are only available intermittently (e.g. during overpass windows). Crucially, keys get 
exhausted as they are used by one-time-pad encryption, so a link with zero remaining 
key material is effectively “dead” until more keys are generated. To maintain end-to-
end connectivity, routing must be dynamic and adaptive in real time. SDN controllers 
are a natural fit: they can continuously monitor link key inventory and quantum-channel 
health and recompute paths on the fly. For instance, Bi et al. describe an SDN-based 
QKD architecture where the controller tracks each link’s remaining key count and 
signal-to-noise, triggering re-routing when a link becomes congested or depleted [14]. 
Their dynamic-routing algorithm (using adjustable key pools and link-blocking 


16 
probabilities) showed lower latency and higher key-usage efficiency in simulations. 
Nonetheless, purely reactive schemes may not suffice for highly dynamic scenarios like 
mobile satellite constellations. Future systems will likely need predictive or AI-
enhanced routing: for example, machine-learning models that forecast link availability 
(based on weather or satellite ephemeris) or key generation rates, and proactively 
reroute before failures occur.

Conclusion 
This research analyzed state-of-the-art routing strategies in QKD networks, 
addressing both theoretical models and practical challenges across terrestrial, satellite, 
and hybrid infrastructures. Unlike classical networks, QKD routing must account for 
unique resource constraints (limited and perishable keys), trust assumptions, and 
dynamic link availability. Our review showed that simple shortest-path approaches, 
while intuitive, often fall short under quantum-specific conditions. In contrast, 
dynamic, key-aware algorithms and SDN-based control frameworks offer better 
adaptability and performance by reconfiguring routes in response to key consumption 
and link changes. Satellite and hybrid QKD networks introduce additional complexity 
due to time-dependent connectivity and cross-layer optimization needs. Routing in such 
contexts requires integration of contact scheduling, security policies, and trust-model 
awareness. Multi-path strategies and SDN-enabled control were identified as essential 
techniques for achieving both robustness and scalability in large QKD networks. We 
conclude that practical QKD routing requires: 
• 
Real-time awareness of quantum link status and key availability. 
• 
Integration with classical control planes (via SDN) to coordinate quantum and 
classical network resources. 
• 
Security-aware path selection that minimizes trust exposure (e.g., using the 
fewest possible trusted relays). 
• 
Standardized interfaces for interoperability and multi-domain coordination. 
Future research should aim to unify routing, key management, and service 
orchestration into a single adaptive framework capable of operating across diverse 
quantum network architectures. By combining robust routing algorithms, intelligent 
control mechanisms, and secure multi-domain coordination, the next generation of 
QKD networks can achieve the scalability and reliability required for real-world 
deployment.
