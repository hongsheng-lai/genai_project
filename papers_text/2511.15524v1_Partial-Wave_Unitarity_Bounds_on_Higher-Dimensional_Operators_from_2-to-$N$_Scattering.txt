ABSTRACT: We present a systematic method for deriving partial-wave unitarity bounds on Wilson
coefficients of higher-dimensional operators in effective field theories involving more than four
fields, which naturally appear in tree-level 2-to-N scattering processes with N ≥3. Unlike 2-to-2
scattering, 2-to-N scattering with N ≥3 features multiple amplitudes associated with the same
total angular momentum. To resolve these degeneracies, we provide a way to construct an or-
thonormal amplitude basis by parameterizing the phase space manifold of massless particles using
spinor-helicity variables, enabling analytical integration over the phase space with arbitrary particle
numbers. We provide Mathematica code to analytically evaluate phase space integrals of interfer-
ence between two local on-shell amplitudes up to four final-state particles, with straightforward
generalization to N final-state particles. As practical applications, we demonstrate the use of this
tool by deriving unitarity bounds on some dimension-7 and dimension-8 operators in the Standard
Model effective field theory involving five and six fields, respectively.

Introduction
In the post-Higgs-discovery era, the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), due to its
universality and systematic nature, has become increasingly popular as a theoretical framework for
analyzing small deviations from Standard Model (SM) predictions caused by hypothetical ultravi-
olet (UV) theories at high energy scales.
Recently, rapid developments on the theoretical side — such as the automation of operator
basis construction, matching computation, and global fit analysis — have paved the way for sys-
tematic phenomenological studies involving a large number of higher-dimensional operators be-
yond the dimension-six level. (For a recent review on computation tools for effective field theories,
see [1]). It has also been shown that several dimension-8 SMEFT operators can be probed at fu-
ture collider experiments [2–15]. However, to interpret the experimental results as the constraints
or measured values of Wilson coefficients, it is essential to ensure that the underlying theoretical
predictions within the SMEFT framework are consistent. Therefore, theoretical consistency condi-
tions — such as partial-wave unitarity bounds and positivity bounds [16], which are derived from
unitarity and locality of the S-matrix — impose important constraints on the allowed structure and
size of EFT operators. Indeed, for a Bayesian global fit, these theoretical constraints can also serve
– 1 –


as priors on the Wilson coefficients from the beginning of the statistical analysis, especially if one
aims to filter out the UV theories that violate fundamental principles.
Positivity bounds in the SMEFT have been extensively studied in recent years [3, 17–28].
For instance, it was shown in [17] that applying positivity constraints to the parameter space of
dimension-8 operators relevant to anomalous quartic gauge couplings excludes approximately 98%
of the experimentally allowed region. However, such positivity bounds can only restrict the Wilson
coefficients to a convex hull in the parameter space, and typically they apply to the 2-to-2 scatter-
ing amplitudes. In contrast, partial-wave unitarity bounds play a complementary role by providing
the upper limits on the Wilson coefficients [26]. Perturbative partial-wave unitarity bounds for
dimension-6 SMEFT operators have been studied extensively in e.g. [29–34], all focusing on the
2-to-2 scattering processes. However, for operators of dimension higher than six, many of them
contain more than four fields, and their leading contributions naturally appear in scattering ampli-
tudes involving more than four external particles. In such cases, it becomes necessary to extend
the analysis of partial-wave unitarity to general 2-to-N scattering processes. For instance, an upper
bound on the scale responsible for neutrino mass generation can be derived from the scaling of
the cross sections of 2-to-N processes [35], while the analysis only relies on the J = 0 partial
wave. Furthermore, the J = 0 unitarity bounds on the EFT operators from the scattering pro-
cess V V →hhh were also studied [36]. Until recent years, the partial-wave amplitude basis was
constructed [37], and the partial-wave unitarity bounds for SMEFT operators beyond dimension
six were studied using 2-to-3 scattering processes [38], where a list of 2-to-3 partial-wave helicity
amplitudes (of the lowest mass dimension) was also provided explicitly. Recently, the authors of
[38] also derived the unitarily bound and compared with the positivity point in axion-like particle
EFT up to dimension-8 [39].
More technically, the study of generalized 2-to-N partial-wave amplitudes has been relatively
limited, mainly due to the following two challenges. First, unlike the 2-to-2 case, where the partial-
wave basis of massless particles is constructed using the well-known Wigner d-functions, the gen-
eral local on-shell amplitude basis for 2-to-N processes was not known until recently. This chal-
lenge was addressed in [37], where a method based on the action of the Casimir operator of the
Poincaré group was introduced. Second, for general 2-to-N scattering, the partial-wave basis can
be degenerate for a given total angular momentum J. Consequently, obtaining an orthogonal set
of basis EFT amplitudes and determining their normalization requires performing the full N-body
phase space integration analytically.
For the massless N-body phase space, Refs. [40, 41] provide an explicit parameterization for
the three-body final state by expressing the spinor-helicity variables of the final-state particles as
complex linear combinations of those of the two initial-state particles. Using a similar approach,
Ref. [42] nearly achieves a complete parameterization of the massless N-body phase space that
resolves all delta functions arising from momentum conservation. However, an explicit expression
for the transformation matrix between the two sets of integration variables at an intermediate step
is missing. Ref. [43] also proposes an N-body phase space parameterization, but it is primarily de-
signed for Monte Carlo phase-space generation and the treatment of infrared divergences, making
it less convenient for the analytical computations considered in this work. Consequently, a fully
explicit and convenient parameterization of the general N-body massless phase-space integral, suit-
able for analytical computation for the local on-shell amplitudes, has not yet been presented in the
– 2 –


literature.
In this paper, we begin by reviewing the basic concepts behind the Casimir operator method,
which enables the systematic construction of the massless partial-wave amplitude basis. This cor-
responds to the bipartite case of the general J-basis amplitudes. Through an explicit example, we
demonstrate how these amplitudes can be derived using a single line of code with the Mathematica
package ABC4EFT [44].
Next, we highlight a key observation: the phase space integral of an N-body massless final
state can be computed analytically using a parametrization inspired by spinor-helicity variables
in Ref. [42]. We find that the missing piece of the explicit transformation matrix in that paper
can be analytically obtained by Sherman-Morrison formula. This enables us to write phase space
integration in closed analytic form using a set of spherical coordinates. To our knowledge, this is
the first derivation of an explicit analytic parametrization and phase space measure for a 4-body
massless final state. Moreover, our method generalizes straightforwardly to the case of N-body
final states. Based on this parameterization, we automate the evaluation of phase space integrals for
the interference of local on-shell amplitudes in 2-to-3 and 2-to-4 scattering processes. We provide
the Mathematica code to assist the reader in performing these integrals analytically. Finally, using
these tools, we demonstrate — through explicit examples — how to derive partial-wave unitarity
bounds for SMEFT dimension-7 and dimension-8 operators with five and six fields, respectively.
This paper is organized as follows. In section. 2, we derive the master formula of unitarity
constraints for the generalized 2-to-N amplitudes starting from the 2-to-2 scattering process. In
section. 3, we review the formalism for constructing the partial-wave amplitudes. In section. 4, we
introduce the general procedure for constructing the orthonormal partial-wave amplitude basis for
a N-body final state, and we illustrate our general procedure with concrete examples of 3-body
and 4-body cases. In section. 5, we discuss how to derive the partial-wave unitarity bounds on the
Wilson coefficients for the SMEFT operators with more than four fields. Finally, we conclude in
section. 6. In appendix. A we summarize our conventions for spinor variables. In appendix. B, we
show how to parameterize the massless N-body phase space using a set of spherical coordinates,
which enables us to perform the integral analytically.

Partial-wave unitarity bounds from 2 →N scattering
The scattering matrix is defined as S = 1 + iT , where T is related to the scattering amplitude
Mi→f as
⟨f|T|i⟩= (2π)4δ4(pf −pi)Mi→f,
(2.1)
where i and f denote the initial and final states, respectively, specified by the four-momenta, he-
licities, and all internal quantum numbers of the particles involved in the scattering process. The
unitarity condition S†S = 1 implies that T −T † = iT †T . As a result, the scattering amplitude
satisfies the condition

f→i = i

where we used the identity ⟨f|T †|i⟩= ⟨i|T |f⟩∗= M∗
f→i(2π)4δ4(pi −pf). The phase space
measure for the intermediate particles is defined as dΠX = Q
j
d3pj
(2π)32Ej . Throughout the paper, we
consider only the scattering amplitudes of massless particles. In the context of SMEFT, this corre-
sponds to the unbroken phase of electroweak symmetry. We assume that taking the massless limit
is a valid approximation for studying the energy scale at which perturbative unitarity is violated.
Indeed, due to the decoupling nature of heavy particles, unitarity violation in SMEFT is expected
to occur only at sufficiently high energies.
To derive the general partial-wave unitarity bound for 2-to-N scattering, we begin by consid-
ering the case where both the initial and final states, i and f, are two-particle states. In this case,
the scattering amplitude is fully determined by the center-of-mass energy s and the scattering angle
θ. For forward elastic scattering (i.e. θ = 0), eq. (2.2) becomes
2ImM(0) =

(2.3)
where we have separated the contributions from the intermediate states X ̸= i from those where
X = i, they correspond to the inelastic scattering and the elastic ones, respectively. Here, M(θ)
denotes the elastic scattering amplitude for a specific 2-to-2 process involving massless particles.
For a specific scattering process with a definite helicity configuration such as Aλ1Bλ2 →
Aλ1Bλ2, the amplitude M(θ) can be expanded in particle waves with definite total angular mo-
mentum J as
M(θ) = 16π
X
J
(J + 1/2)dJ
λλ(θ)T J(s),
(2.4)
where dJ
λλ is the Wigner d-matrix and λ = λ1−λ2 is the helicity difference in the initial state. Sub-
stitute the partial-wave expansion of M(θ) into the second term on the right-hand side of eq. (2.3)
yields
Z sin θdθ
16π
|M(θ)|2 = P
J 16π(J + 1/2)|T J(s)|2,

where we have used the orthonormality condition for the Wigner d-matrix:
Z
dJ
λµdJ′
λµd cos θ =

(J + 1/2).
(2.6)
Likewise, the left-hand side of eq. (2.3) can be decomposed into partial waves as
2 ImM(0) = 2
X
J
16π(J + 1/2) dJ
λλ(0) ImT J(s) .
(2.7)

Since the S-matrix is block-diagonal in total angular momentum J (i.e., angular momentum con-
servation), one can isolate each J-block in eq. (2.8). For a 2-to-2 scattering process with definite
total angular momentum J, we have the partial-wave unitarity bound as
|T J| ≤2,
0 ≤ImT J ≤2,
|ReT J| ≤1.
(2.9)
This result is well known in the literature.
We now derive the partial-wave unitarity bounds for 2-to-N scattering from eq. (2.8), a result
much less explored in the literature. Let us begin by decomposing the amplitude as
Mi→X =
X
J,a
CJa
i→XBJa
i→X ,
(2.10)
where J denotes the total angular momentum with the corresponding partial-wave amplitude BJa
i→X,
which is a function of the four-momenta of all the external particles. As we will see in concrete ex-
amples in section 3, the partial-wave amplitudes for a fixed J may not be unique. Consequently, we
introduce an additional index a to label the degeneracy for the partial-wave amplitudes with fixed
J. All other relevant information, such as the Wilson coefficients and gauge quantum numbers, is
included in CJa
i→X. We assume that the basis amplitudes BJa
i→X satisfy the following orthonormality
condition

i→X(BJ′a′
i→X)∗(2π)4δ4(pX −pi) ≡

i→X(s)δaa′δJJ′,
(2.11)
it means that amplitudes with different quantum numbers J and a are orthogonal to each other after
integrating over the N-body phase space of the intermediate state. It follows that, for each partial
wave J, the unitarity condition in eq. (2.8) becomes
2ImT J(s) =

i→X(s)|CJa
i→X|2
16π(J + 1/2)

(2.12)
From eq. (2.12), we obtain the master formula for the partial-wave unitarity bounds for 2-to-N
scattering amplitudes:
P

i→X(s)|CJa
i→X|2

Constructing partial-wave amplitudes
As seen from eqs. (2.11) and (2.13), once the basis for the partial-wave amplitudes BJa
i→X and
their corresponding normalization factors gJa
i→X(s) are determined, one can derive the partial-wave
unitarity bounds on the Wilson coefficients that appear in the amplitude for the process i →X.
Therefore, the first task is to systematically construct the basis of BJa
i→X, which can be achieved by
taking the following steps:
1. For a given mass dimension, we first systematically construct a basis of local, on-shell ampli-
tudes with the Young Tensor Method [45, 46] using spinor-helicity variables. The amplitude
basis obtained as such is denoted as Y-basis. The advantage of this method is that it automat-
ically removes the redundancies from momentum conservation and the Schouten identity.
– 5 –


2. Within the space of the complete Y-basis amplitudes, we determine the matrix representation
of the Casimir operator W 2 = WµW µ of the Poincaré group.
Here, W µ is the Pauli-Lubanski vector defined as Wµ = 1
2ϵµνρσP µMρσ, where P µ is the
momentum operator and Mµν is the Lorentz group generator. In terms of spinor-helicity
variables, we have
W 2 = 1
8P 2(Tr[M2] + Tr[ f
M2]) −1
4Tr[P ⊺MP f
M] .
(3.1)
where P = Pµσµ
α ˙α, P ⊺= Pµ¯σµ ˙αα, and M, f
M are the chiral components defined as
Mµνσµ
α ˙ασν
β ˙β = ϵαβ f
M ˙α ˙β +˜ϵ ˙α ˙βMαβ. For a given subset I of particles in a scattering process,

M ˙α ˙β and Mαβ act on amplitudes as the differential operators:

(3.2)
It is the summation over the subset I of particles that enables us to define the specific scat-
tering channel with definite angular momentum.
3. We obtain the partial-wave amplitudes BJa
I→X as the eigenvectors of the matrix representa-
tion of W 2
I, such that W 2
IBJa
I→X = −sIJ(J + 1)BJa
I→X, where sI ≡(P
i∈I pi)2. This
set of partial-wave amplitudes forms the J-basis for the given scattering channel I. (In the
rest of the paper, we will use the terms "partial-wave amplitudes" and "J-basis amplitudes"
interchangeably.)
For clarity, we illustrate the steps described above with a simple example. Let us consider
the scattering process involving five massless particles ψ1ϕ2ϕ3ϕ4ψ†
5, where ϕ, ψ, ψ† represent
particles with helicities 0, −1/2, and 1/2, respectively. The subscripts of these fields correspond
to the labeling of their momenta.
1. Using the Young Tensor Method, we identify two amplitudes of mass dimension two in the
Y-basis
By
1 = ⟨14⟩[45],
By
2 = −[35]⟨13⟩,
(3.3)
where all the particles are considered to be incoming.
2. Suppose we focus on partial-wave amplitudes for the particles ϕ2ϕ3. Acting the Casimir op-
erator W 2
23 on the amplitudes By
1 and By
2 yields the following amplitudes of mass dimension

(3.5)
Importantly, the right-handed side of these equations can be rewritten as linear combinations
of the original amplitudes By
1 and By
2 after factoring out the kinematic variable s23 = (p2 +
p3)2. Hence, the matrix representation of (W2

(3.6)

3. Diagonalizing the above matrix W2
23 yields two eigenvalues, −2s23 and 0, and they corre-
spond to the angular momentum channels J = 0 and J = 1, respectively. The associated
eigenvectors are
BJ=0 : ⟨14⟩[45],
BJ=1 : −2⟨13⟩[35] −⟨14⟩[45].
(3.7)
These eigenvectors BJ=0 and BJ=1 are the J-basis amplitudes for the particles ϕ2,3.
Unlike 2-to-2 scattering, one prominent feature of the J-basis amplitudes for 2-to-N processes
with N ≥3 is that, for a fixed total angular momentum, the corresponding J-basis amplitudes can
be non-unique. We illustrate this point with the amplitudes of mass dimension 2 in the scattering
process of five scalar particles, which corresponds to the effective operator of the type ϕ5D2. To
start, we have the Y-basis amplitudes
By
1 = −s45, By
2 = s35, By
3 = −s34, By
4 = −s25, By
5 = s24,
(3.8)
where sij = (pi + pj)2, and all the particles are the incoming ones. The corresponding J-basis
amplitudes for the scattering channel initiated by ϕ1ϕ2 are given by
BJ=0,a=1,2,3
0,0;0,0,0
: −s34, s35, −s45,
(3.9)
BJ=1,a=1,2
0,0;0,0,0
: 2s24 + s34 + s45, −2s25 −s35 −s45,
(3.10)
where both the J = 0 and J = 1 partial-wave amplitudes are degenerate.
The procedure for obtaining the J-basis amplitudes described above is fully automated us-
ing the Mathematica package ABC4EFT [44]. To be specific, this is realized by the function
W2Diagonalize[state,k,ch], which requires three inputs: "state", the particle configu-
ration listed in an order of increasing helicities; "k", the number of derivatives in the corresponding
operator; "ch", the subset of particles specifying the scattering channel for which partial-wave am-
plitudes of definite angular momentum are constructed. For example, the J-basis amplitudes shown
in eq. (3.7) can be obtained by the following command:
In[1]:= W2Diagonalize[{-1/2, 0,0,0, 1/2}, 1, {2, 3}] //Ampform
Out[1]= <|"basis"→
[45]<14>,-[35]<13>
	, "j"→{1, 0},
"transfer"→{{-1, 2}, {1, 0}}, "j-basis"→
-2[35]<13>-[45]<14>,
[45]<14>
	|>
The output contains four keys: "basis", the complete and independent Y-basis of amplitudes con-
structed with the Young tensor method; "j", a list of total angular momentum values allowed for
the specified scattering channel; "transfer", the transformation matrix from the Y-basis to the J-
basis; "j-basis", the concrete J-basis amplitudes for the scattering channel, ordered according to
the entries in the "j" list. In this way, one can verify the partial-wave 5-point amplitudes (up to
normalization) that appear in the appendix of [38], where only the local on-shell amplitudes of the
lowest dimension are included for each helicity configuration.

Phase space integral and normalization of partial-wave amplitudes
In the previous section, we introduced a systematic method for constructing the partial-wave ampli-
tude basis for scattering processes involving more than two particles in the final state. To obtain the
partial-wave unitarity bound as given in eq. (2.13), it remains to compute the normalization factor
gJa
i→X(s), which requires performing the N-body phase space integral over the final-state massless
particles, as shown in eq. (2.11).
4.1
N-body phase space
In this section, we introduce a general parameterization for the N-body phase space integral using
a set of spherical variables. Following [42], the phase space manifold of N massless particles can
be decomposed into the product of a (N −1)-simplex and a (2N −3)-sphere, i.e.
dΠN(2π)4 δ4
 
P −

i=1

!
= (2π)4−3NsN−2d∆N−1 × dS2N−3 ,
(4.1)
where s is the center-of-mass energy squared of all the N massless particles. In appendix B, we
provide a lightning review on the derivation of the integration measures d∆N−1 and dS2N−3, based
on a parametrization using the spinor-helicity variables of the N massless particles involved in the
phase space. In the following, we only highlight the main results.
Based on the spinor-helicity formalism, the integration variables can be chosen to be two
complex N-component vectors, ⃗u = (u1, u2, · · · , uN)T and ⃗v = (v1, v2, · · · , vN)T . Intuitively,
each pair of complex numbers (ui, vi) are the coefficients expanding the spinor |pi⟩for each particle
on the two basis spinors |k1⟩and |k2⟩of momenta of incoming particles, i.e. |pi⟩= ui|k1⟩+vi|k2⟩.
Parameterizing ⃗u = (r1e−iϕ1, r2e−iϕ2, · · · , rNe−iϕN )T , and gauge fixing the ϕi = 0 with
little group redundancy, the integration over ⃗u can be shown to be equivalent to the integration on
a (N −1)-simplex, of which the integration measure is given by:
d∆N−1 =

In the spherical coordinates we can further parameterize ri as:
rN = cos θN−1 ,
rN−1 = sin θN−1 cos θN−2 ,
rN−2 = sin θN−1 sin θN−2 cos θN−3 ,
...
r2 = sin θN−1 . . . sin θ2 cos θ1 ,
r1 = sin θN−1 . . . sin θ2 sin θ1 .
(4.3)
Since ri > 0, all θi are within [0, π/2]. It follows that

(4.7)
Here ξi ∈[0, 2π], ηi ∈[0, π/2]. Most importantly, we derive an analytical formula for the real and
symmetric transformation matrix O in terms of ri:

With eq. (4.3), (4.5), (4.7) and (4.8), we can construct the explicit parameterization of ⃗u and ⃗v
in terms of ηi, ξi and θi, and the δ-function imposed by momentum conservation is fully resolved.
To illustrate the power of the general formalism outlined above, we derive explicit expressions for
the 3-body and 4-body phase spaces, and the generalization to the N-body case follows straight-
forwardly.

Given the phase space measure dΠN, the interference between two local on-shell partial-
wave amplitudes can always be computed analytically, since each term in the amplitude square
decomposes into a product of cos and sin functions of the integration variables. In the following,
we illustrate this in two examples for dΠ3 and dΠ4, respectively.

Normalization of 2 →3 and 2 →4 partial-wave amplitudes
Let us consider an operator of the type ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3ψ4ψ†
5D, which generates on-shell local ampli-
tudes involving particles of the helicity configuration (0, 0, 0, −1/2, 1/2). 1 Using the package
ABC4EFT [44], one can find two independent J-basis amplitudes with the total angular momentum
J = 1 or 0 for the scattering process
ϕ1(p1)ϕ2(p2) →ϕ3(−p3)ψ†
4(−p4)ψ5(−p5) .
(4.15)
The corresponding J-basis amplitudes are the same by applying a proper cyclic relabeling of the
external particles (4321) to the amplitudes given in eq. (3.7), where the momentum conservation
P5
i=1 pi = 0 and p0
i=3,4,5 < 0 are considered. Analytic continuation to the region with p0
i > 0
amounts to flipping the sign of the angle spinors λα
3,4,5 while leaving the remaining square spinors
unchanged, as detailed in appendix A. The normalization of these two amplitudes can be calculated
accordingly as
gJ=0
0,0;0,−1/2,1/2 =

BJ=0

E
=

1024π3 .
(4.16)
In cases where there is degeneracy for a fixed J, the corresponding basis can be orthogonalized
within that subspace at a fixed amplitude dimension. This simplifies the computation of the partial-
wave unitarity bounds for a given operator. Again, we consider the operator of the type ϕ5D2 as an
example. The J-basis amplitudes are derived in eq. (3.9) and (3.10), where we find two amplitudes
with J = 1 and three with J = 0. Using our phase space parameterization of dΠ3, the interference
metric tensor can be obtained analytically as follows:

A Mathematica code implementing phase space integration
To assist the reader in analytically computing the phase space integrals for the interference between
partial-wave amplitudes, we provide the Mathematica code, which can be downloaded in from the
GitHub link2.
The key function is PSIntAMPUser[amp1,amp2,n,in]. It takes four inputs: the first
two are the amplitudes whose interference is being calculated; the third is the total number of final-
state particles n; the fourth is a list of two indices indicating which two particles are treated as the
initial-state ones. Overall, the function evaluates the following integral:
PSIntAMPUser[M1, M2, n, {i, j}] =
Z
dΠk/∈{i,j}(2π)4δ4(pi + pj −

where ab and sb denote the angle and square brackets, and all momenta are treated as incoming.
The variable s in the output represents the center-of-mass energy squared of the two initial-state
particles. We validate our calculation against the known total volume of the three- and four-body
phase space and verify across multiple examples that partial-wave amplitudes with different total
angular momentum are indeed orthogonal.
Furthermore, we also provide the function to compute the metric of the J-basis amplitudes,
given the helicities of the external particles and the number of derivatives in the corresponding
operators. The function GetJbasisMetric[hellist,nD,in] takes three inputs: the first
is the list of helicities of external particles {hi} ordered from the most negative to the most posi-
tive; the second parameter represents the number of derivatives #D in the corresponding operator,
which fixes the mass dimension of the amplitude to be Pn
i=1 |hi|+#D, where n is the total number
of external particles; the last input is the label of particles that are considered to be the incoming
particles. The output of this function is a table as in figure. 1, where the first column includes the
possible values of total angular momentum for the scattering channel; the second column includes
the J-basis amplitudes obtained from the W2Diagonalize; the last column includes the metrics
for the inner product of the amplitudes in the same J subspace, and the labeling of the indices is in
order with the ones in the second column.

Partial-wave unitarity bounds for dimension-7 and dimension-8 operators in SMEFT
In this section, we use the orthogonal partial-wave amplitude basis, obtained in the previous sec-
tion, to derive the perturbative unitarity bounds for two SMEFT operators, i.e. eRlLH†3D and
H2H†2eReRD. In particular, we will illustrate how to treat the gauge and flavor quantum numbers
when deriving the bounds.
5.1
A dimension-7 example: eRlLH†3D
We first consider an operator that violates the lepton number and can contribute to the process
of neutrinoless double beta decay [47]. At the dimension-7 level, there is only one independent
operator of this type. In four-component fermion notation, the operator is given by

amplitudes are obtained as in eq. (3.7)
BJ=0 = ⟨14⟩[45],
BJ=1 = −(2⟨13⟩[35] + ⟨14⟩[45]),
(5.4)
and their normalization factors can be found in eq. (4.16). One can find the coordinates of the full
amplitude Mf1f5
i2i3i4i5 on this J-basis as

We find that the partial-wave amplitudes have the same form as in eq. (5.10) and eq. (5.11), even
though they correspond to total angular momentum J = 1 instead of J = 1/2. The normalization

If we assume a U(3)eR flavor symmetry, then only the diagonal Wilson coefficients are non-zero
and are equal to the same value, then all the different scattering channels provide the same bound
on the Wilson coefficient.
To summarize, to obtain the optimal partial-wave unitarity bound for a given SMEFT operator
containing more than four fields, one proceeds with the following steps:
1. Construct the amplitude basis for the type of operator being considered.
2. Determine the partial-wave (i.e. J-basis) amplitudes using the Casimir operator method.
3. Identify all possible 2-to-N scattering channels relevant to the operator.
4. For each scattering channel, decompose the amplitude onto the J-basis, and derive the strongest
unitarity bound among different partial waves and gauge components.
5. Iterate over all the scattering channels and select the optimal bound as the final result.
Note that in the examples discussed above, we have, for simplicity, assumed that only a single
SMEFT operator contributes in the analysis. However, in a complete analysis, multiple operators
can contribute to the same scattering channel. We leave such a comprehensive analysis to future
work.

Conclusion
In this paper, we study the generalized partial-wave unitarity bounds derived from 2-to-N scattering
amplitudes and show that they impose theoretical consistency constraints on the Wilson coefficients
of higher-dimensional operators in effective field theories involving more than four fields.
We outline a general procedure — based on the Casimir operator method — for systemati-
cally constructing the local on-shell partial-wave amplitude basis at a given mass dimension. This
method uses the Young tensor method to generate an amplitude basis, from which the represen-
tation matrix of the W 2 Casimir operator of the Poincaré group is constructed. The partial-wave
– 17 –


amplitude basis is then obtained by diagonalizing this matrix. We further highlight that, in general
2-to-N scattering processes, partial-wave amplitudes for a fixed total angular momentum and a
given mass dimension can be degenerate. Such a degeneracy can be partially resolved by consid-
ering mutually commuting angular momentum operators associated with subsets of the final-state
particles.
To determine the unitarity bound for each partial wave, it is first necessary to compute the
normalization factor. This requires computing the N-body phase space integrals between pairs
of amplitudes in the partial-wave basis. To enable analytic evaluation of the massless N-body
phase space integrals, we map the integral onto a compact manifold, given by the product of a
(N −1)-simplex and a (2N −3)-sphere. We show that the coordinate transformation between
the four-momenta of final-state particles and the spherical coordinates on this compact manifold
can be solved analytically by leveraging the spinor-helicity representation of massless momenta.
As examples, we provide concrete parameterizations of the spinor-helicity variables for the 3- and
4-body final states using the aforementioned spherical coordinates, along with the corresponding
integration measures. Additionally, we provide Mathematica code that automates the analytical
computation of the resulting phase space integrals. Finally, with two examples, we illustrate how to
derive the partial-wave unitarity bounds on the Wilson coefficients of SMEFT operators containing
more than four fields.
We believe that these theoretical bounds will serve as valuable inputs when applying effective
field theory to interpret results from precision measurements across a wide range of current and
future experimental programs.

Conventions for spinor-helicity variables

positive-energy momenta Ei > 0, where i labels the i-th external particle:

The spinor indices can be raised and lowered using the totally anti-symmetric ϵ tensors defined by
ϵ12 = ϵ21 = ϵ˙1˙2 = ϵ˙2˙1 = 1, so that
|i⟩α ≡λiα = ϵαβλβ
i ,
|˜i] ˙α ≡˜λ ˙α
i = ϵ ˙α ˙β˜λi ˙β.
(A.2)
One can verify that this parameterization indeed satisfies the following identities:
piα ˙α ≡piµσµ
α ˙α = λiα˜λi ˙α,
p ˙αα
i
≡piµ¯σµ ˙αα = ˜λi ˙αλiα.
(A.3)
where pµ = (E, px, py, pz), σµ = (1, σ), ¯σµ = (1, −σ), with σ denoting the Pauli matrices.
A state vector |p; h, M = 0⟩in the massless unitary irreducible representation of the Poincaré
group is labeled by the three momentum vector p, which corresponds to the eigenvalue of the
spatial translation generator. On the other hand, the helicity h labels the irreducible representation
of the little group (i.e. the two-dimensional Euclidean group), which underlies the construction
of massless Poincaré representations. From Wigner’s little group classification, a general Lorentz
transformation Λ acting on the state |p; h, M = 0⟩induces a phase factor that depends on both Λ
and the momentum p of the state. One can view the spinor variables as a realization of the massless
irreducible representation of the Poincaré group with h = ±1/2, such that
Λ →D−1
2 [Λ],
|p; h⟩→λ(p),
(A.4)
D−1
2 [Λ].λ(p) = eiw(Λ,p)/2λ(Λp),
(A.5)
where D−1
2 [Λ] denotes the spin-1/2 representation of the Lorentz group and w(Λ, p) is the little
group phase factor.
The parameterization of the spinors in eq. (A.1) is defined for momentum with p0 > 0. For
negative energy momenta (i.e., p0 < 0), we analytically extend the definition of the spinor variables
as follows:
λα(p) ≡−λα(−p), ˜λ ˙α(p) ≡˜λ ˙α(−p), for p0 < 0,
(A.6)
which preserves eq. (A.3). In addition, for real momenta, the spinor satisfy (λα)∗= ±˜λ ˙α, where
the minus sign applies to momenta with p0 < 0.

Phase space integral for N massless particles
We review the N-body phase space of massless particles following [42]. We leave the more tech-
nical discussions in this appendix while highlighting our main results in section 4. For a more
complete discussion, we refer the readers to [42].

where s = P 2 is the square of the center-of-mass energy. When all particles are massless, instead
of using the three-momenta pi, it is convenient to use the spinor-helicity variables as the integration
variables, where for each four-momentum we replace pi with (pi)α ˙α = λiα˜λi ˙α and (˜λi ˙α)∗= λiα.
Hence, the integration measure for the on-shell four-momentum pi becomes
d4piδ(p2
i )Θ(Ei) = d2λiα d2˜λi ˙α
U(1)
≡sdui dvi
U(1)
,
(B.3)
where the U(1) in the denominator denotes the redundant little group transformation (that should
eventually be removed for each pi), ui and vi are the two complex numbers parameterizing pi. One
can view ui and vi as the coefficients when projecting the spinor |pi⟩on the two basis spinors |k1⟩
and |k2⟩, i.e. |pi⟩= ui|k1⟩+ vi|k2⟩. 4 All the N pairs of the two complex numbers (ui, vi) form
two complex N-component vectors ⃗u = (u1, u2, · · · , uN)T and ⃗v = (v1, v2, · · · , vN)T , i.e.,

|p1⟩|p2⟩· · · |pN⟩
T =
 
u1 u2 · · · uN
v1 v2 · · · vN
!T  
|k1⟩
|k2⟩
!

(B.4)
With the parameterization of ui and vi, the phase space can be written as
dΠN = (2π)4−3NsN−2 dNudNv
U(1)N δ(1 −|⃗u|2)δ(1 −|⃗v|2)δ2(⃗u†⃗v),
(B.5)
where the superscript 2 in the last δ-function indicates that it is for a complex variable. More
precisely, for Pα ˙α −PN
i=1(pi)α ˙α inside the δ function, 1 −|⃗u|2 matches the (α, ˙α) = (1, 1)
component, 1−|⃗v|2 matches the (α, ˙α) = (2, 2) component, while ⃗u†⃗v matches the (α, ˙α) = (1, 2)
component.
More specifically, removing the redundancy of the little group U(1)N factor amounts to fixing
the phase of one of the complex variables for each pair of ui and vi. Without loss of generality, we
choose to set ui = rieiϕi and send all ϕi to zero, i.e.,

4One convenient choice for the basis spinors is that |k1⟩= (1, 0)T and |k2⟩= (0, 1)T , which can be interpreted as
the two spinors of the initial-state particles moving in the forward and backward directions, respectively.

To perform the integral over v1,...,N−1, we need to make a symmetric real transformation for the
variables v′ = O−1v such that 1 −PN−1
i=1 |vi|2 −|vN|2 = 1 −PN−1
i=1 |v′|2, where the coordinates
of v′

N−2 = e−iξN−2 sin η1 . . . sin ηN−3 cos ηN−2
v′
N−1 = e−iξN−1 sin η1 . . . sin ηN−3 sin ηN−2.
Here ξi ∈[0, 2π], ηi ∈[0, π/2]. These coordinates can be viewed as embedding S2N−3 into
CN−1 [42]. Using these new variables, the relevant integral measure for dS2N−3 is given by 5

After including the Jacobian for v′ = O−1v, we finally obtain the measure of S2N−3.
From eq. (B.8) and the condition PN−1
