Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a universe described by Lyra’s
geometry in the presence of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). Dark energy is modeled
as a quintessence scalar field with bulk viscosity, while dark matter is allowed to interact
with the scalar sector. The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra’s manifold,
provides an additional geometric contribution. By employing dynamical system techniques,
we analyze stability properties and late-time attractors. Our results indicate that viscosity
and DE–DM interaction enrich the phase space structure and can help address both the
cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by performing a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with recent observational datasets, we derive best-fit
values for the model parameters that exhibit good consistency with current data.

scale dynamics. Over the past two decades, diverse and independent probes, such as Type
Ia supernovae (SNIa) [1, 2], baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) [3] and cosmic microwave
background radiation (CMBR) [4, 5] have provided compelling evidence for the late - time
accelerated expansion of the Universe. Observational cosmology has established that the
luminous baryonic component, comprising star, interstellar gas, and other radiating matter,
accounts for only about 4.9 % of the total mass - energy density of the Universe. High
precision measurements from the PLANCK satellite have provided captivating evidence that
the remaining cosmic inventory is dominated by two non - luminous constituents; such
as dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). The DM component is non - baryonic and
collisionless in nature. It’s presence can be understood solely through gravitational effects
on galactic rotation curves, gravitational lensing, large scale structure formation etc. Dark
matter contributes 26.8 % of the total energy density of the Universe. The rest around 69.3
% is attributed to DE. It is a hypothetical form of energy, which exists negative pressure that
acts in opposition to gravity and driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe observed
in the late - time cosmological epoch.
As discussed earlier, the negative pressure attributed to DE counteracts the attractive
influence of gravity, thereby causing the accelerated expansion of the Universe and preventing
an ultimate gravitational collapse. Therefore, a wide range of theoretical models have been
developed to explain the physical origin and dynamical properties of DE and the ensuing
late - time acceleration. The most straight forward and widely accepted explanation is the
cosmological constant (Λ), introduced by Einstein in his field equations of general relativity
as a constant vacuum energy density term.
This forms the basis of the Λ - cold dark
matter (CDM) model, where DE is characterized by a constant equation of state parameter,
ω = p/ρ = −1, implying a uniform energy density through out spacetime. High - precision
data from the Planck CMB mission have reaffirmed the ΛCDM model as the observationally
consistent and theoretically feasible description of the Universe’s large scale dynamics [5].
Although the ΛCDM model remains one of the cornerstones of modern cosmology, it is
not yet regarded as the ultimate framework for understanding our Universe [9]. From a the-
oretical perspective, the underlying physics of DE and DM continues to elude a fundamental
explanation. The model also suffers from persistent conceptual challenges, notably the fine
tuning and cosmic coincidence problems associated with the cosmological constant [9, 10]. It
has been observed that, while Λ successfully reproduces the large scale distribution of matter
and the evolution of cosmic structures, it encounters several inconsistencies on galactic and
sub - galactic scales, such as the missing satellites, core - cusp and too - big - to fail problem
[11]. In parallel, the advent of high - precision cosmological observations has brought to light
additional tensions within the ΛCDM framework. The most prominent one among these is
the H0 tension, referring to the nearly 5σ discrepancy between the Hubble constant (H0)


3
inferred from Planck CMB measurements and that derived from local standard candle and
gravitational lensing time delay observations [12] - [14]. Another emerging inconsistency is
the S8 tension, which reflects 1 - 2σ deviation between the parameter S8 = σ8(Ωm)0.5 ob-
tained from Planck data and the results from weak lensing surveys [15] -[18]. With the rapid
progress of observational cosmology, such discrepancies have been more significant, suggest-
ing potential limitations of the ΛCDM model and motivating the search for new physics
beyond the standard cosmological problem.
As the fundamental nature and origin of DE remain elusive, cosmologists have proposed a
broad spectrum of theoretical models to interpret this cosmic phenomenon. In general, the
proposals are classified into two categories: DE model [19, 20] and modified gravity theories
[21, 22]. The former class retains the framework of Einstein’s general relativity but introduces
additional components, such as scalar fields, exotic fields or dynamical vacuum energy to
account for the observed accelerated expansion. Prominent examples such as quintessence,
k - essence and phantom field models attribute cosmic acceleration to a time varying energy
component with negative pressure. Dynamical DE models, such as quintessence scalar fields,
have therefore been widely explored [23, 24, 25]. The latter one postulates that general
relativity may break down on cosmological scales and therefore modifies the Einstein - Hilbert
action by introducing alternative gravitational terms motivated by deeper physical principles.
Representative theories in this category include f(R) gravity, Brans - Dicke theory and Gauss
- Bonet modifications. They are all aiming to reproduce the effects of DE through geometric
or curvature - based mechanisms rather than involving a separate energy field.
In thermodynamics, every realistic fluid system inherently involves dissipative processes,
which refer to the irreversible loss of energy due to internal friction and viscosity. These
processes play a significant role in cosmological dynamics, as they influence how the Uni-
verse evolves over time. In cosmology, such dissipation manifests through bulk and shear
viscosities within the stress–energy tensor of the cosmic fluid [26, 27]. While shear viscosity,
which relates to the resistance against shape deformation, can usually be ignored on large
cosmic scales due to the Universe’s isotropy and homogeneity. On the other hand, bulk
viscosity, associated with resistance to volume changes during cosmic expansion, becomes
crucial. The effects of bulk viscosity have been extensively explored in the frameworks of
viscous dark matter (VDM) [28, 29], viscous dark energy (VDE) [30] - [33], and cosmic in-
flation. Interestingly, viscosity has been proposed as a potential factor behind the present
acceleration of the Universe. Apart from influencing the Hubble expansion, viscosity also
leads to additional entropy production, which heats both baryonic and DM components.
Therefore, it influences the thermal history and structure formation of the Universe.
Another line of investigation involves allowing DE to exchange energy with DM. Inter-
action terms of the form Q ∝Hρ are consistent with observations and may alleviate the


4
coincidence problem as well as the H0 and σ8 tensions [34, 35, 36, 37]. In addition, such
interactions can emerge naturally in frameworks where the DM mass depends on the scalar
field [38, 39]. A further intriguing theory that has arisen as a potential framework to provide
fresh perspectives on this cosmic interplay is mass - varying DM. Here, we explore the math-
ematical models that describe the DE - DM interaction, concentrating on mass - varying
DM. The theory of mass - varying DM postulates that the mass of DM particles, which
is commonly represented by the symbol (m), is a function of time rather than a constant,
(m = m(t)). This theory presents a scalar field to characterize the variance in DM mass,
which is commonly represented as (ϕ). For mass -varying DM, the Lagrangian can be writ-
ten as: Lmass-varying DM = 1
2gµν∂µϕ∂νϕ −V (ϕ) + LDM(m(t), ΨDM), where, gµν is the metric
tensor. ∂µ represents the covariant derivative with respect to spacetime coordinate µ. V (ϕ)
is the potential energy associated with the scalar field ϕ. ΨDM represents the DM fields. An
effective coupling term that modulates the interaction intensity between the scalar field ϕ
and DE fields describes the interaction between mass - varying DM and DE.
On the geometric side, Lyra [40] proposed a modification of Riemannian geometry through
a displacement vector field. Sen [41] later formulated field equations in this setting, which
reduce to general relativity when the displacement vector vanishes. Constant or time-varying
displacement vectors can mimic a cosmological constant or stiff matter, offering novel mecha-
nisms to model cosmic acceleration [42, 43, 44]. Recent work has extended scalar-tensor the-
ories to Lyra geometry, yielding modified Friedmann equations with rich dynamics [45, 46].
In this work, we investigate a cosmological framework that integrates Lyra geometry,
a canonical scalar field and bulk viscous dark energy interacting with mass-varying dark
matter.
Through a detailed dynamical systems analysis, we show that the interplay of
the Lyra displacement field and viscous effects.
The model admits stable de Sitter like
attractors driven by viscous dark energy and supports smooth transitions between matter
and dark-energy–dominated epochs. Using Pantheon+ SNe Ia, BAO measurements and the
SH0ES H0 prior, we further constrain the model parameters via MCMC analysis, finding
excellent agreement with current low-redshift observations. The small negative interaction
parameter and the allowed viscosity values help reproduce the present expansion rate and
may alleviate the H0 tension. Overall, the combined dynamical and observational results
indicate that viscous dark energy in the Lyra manifold is a viable extension of standard
cosmology capable of providing a unified description of cosmic evolution.
The structure of this paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 deals with the formation of
the mathematical model consisting of interacting viscous DE and mass-varying DM in the
background of Lyra geometry. Section 3 addresses the dynamical analysis of the evaluated
model through critical point studies. It also includes physical interpretations of the evaluated
critical points and a stability analysis of such critical points.
Section 4 focuses on the


5
cosmological stability and instability through phase portrait analysis. In section 5, we present
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using some recent observational datasets to
validate our result observationally. Lastly, in section 6 we conclude the paper.

Model Formulation: Interacting Viscous Dark En-
ergy in Lyra Geometry
In Lyra’s modification of Riemannian geometry [40], the affine connection is altered by the
introduction of a displacement vector field ψµ and corresponding metric tensor gµν. Sen [41]
showed that the corresponding field equations can be written as
Gµν + 3
2ψµψν −3
4gµνψαψα = Tµν,
(1)
where Gµν is the Einstein tensor and Tµν denotes the matter energy–momentum tensor.
When ψµ = 0, the above reduces to Einstein’s field equations.
For a spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaˆıtre–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) spacetime
ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t) (dr2 + r2dΩ2).
(2)
We assume ψµ = (β(t), 0, 0, 0), where β(t) is a function of cosmic time.
The energy-
momentum tensor consists of pressureless DM and DE described by a scalar field with bulk
viscosity. Explicitly,
Tµν = (ρtot + ptot)uµuν −ptotgµν,
(3)
where ρtot is total density defined by ρtot = ρm(matter density)+ρϕ(energy density) and total
pressure ptot = peff
ϕ . uµ and uν indicate four velocity tensors.
The scalar field energy density and pressure are
ρϕ = 1
2
˙ϕ2 + V (ϕ),
(4)
pϕ = 1
2
˙ϕ2 −V (ϕ).
(5)
The presence of viscosity in DE fluid influences the dynamics of the Universe. The effective
pressure at thermal equilibrium for a typical bulk viscous DE fluid can be expressed as
peff
ϕ = pϕ −ζθ,
(6)
where ζ denotes bulk viscosity coefficient. The expansion scalar (θ) can be written as θ =
3H = ˙a
a, H and a stand for the Hubble parameter and scalar factor respectively. Therefore,
the effective pressure can be restated as
peff
ϕ = pϕ −3ζH.
(7)


6
The negative contribution −3ζH modifies the dilution rate of dark energy and can mimic
phantom-like behavior when sufficiently large [47, 48, 49].
By considering these factors, the Lyra-modified Friedmann equations become
3H2 −β2(t) = ρm + ρϕ,
(8)
2 ˙H + 3H2 + β2(t) = −peff
ϕ .
(9)
The terms involving β2(t) represent the contribution of Lyra’s displacement vector. For a
constant β, this behaves as a cosmological constant; for a dynamical β(t), it acts as an
additional time-dependent dark sector component.
2.1
Interaction in the Dark Sector
In standard cosmology, dark matter and dark energy are assumed to evolve independently,
each conserving its energy density separately. Here, we rely on this assumption and allow
an explicit interaction term Q that mediates energy transfer between the two sectors. The
total conservation equation
˙ρtot + 3H(ρtot + ptot) = 0,
(10)
is then split as
˙ρm + 3Hρm = Q,
(11)
˙ρϕ + 3H(ρϕ + peff
ϕ ) = −Q.
(12)
Therefore, a positive Q corresponds to energy transfer from DE to DM, while a negative
Q represents the reverse. The functional form of Q is not uniquely determined; commonly
adopted forms include
Q1 = 3δ ˙ϕρm,
Q2 = 3δ ˙ϕρϕ,
Q3 = 3δ ˙ϕM ′
m(ϕ)
Mm(ϕ)ρm,
Q = 3δ ˙ϕ

,
(13)
with δ a dimensionless coupling parameter constrained by observations [34, 35, 36] and
Mm(ϕ) is the scalar field-dependent mass of the matter component. Such interactions can
ease the cosmic coincidence problem and affect the late-time attractors of the system.
2.2
Effective Dark Sector Dynamics
Combining Eqs. (8)–(12), we see that three distinct ingredients govern cosmic dynamics in
this framework:
1. The displacement field β(t) from Lyra geometry, which adds a geometric correction
that can mimic a cosmological constant or stiff component depending on its evolution.


7
2. Bulk viscous pressure in the scalar field sector, which alters the effective equation of
state and can drive accelerated or phantom-like expansion.
3. Interaction between DM and DE, parametrized by Q, which redistributes energy in
the dark sector and modifies the background expansion and structure growth.
This combined setup provides a richer phase space than standard quintessence or inter-
acting models, and allows us to investigate whether the interplay between Lyra geometry,
viscosity, and interaction can naturally generate late-time accelerated attractors consistent
with observations.

In the above equations Ωϕ, Ωm ,ΩV iscous, Ωβ, and ΩLyra represent the fractional densities due
to DE, DM, viscous fluid, Lyra geometric displacement field, and auxiliary term, respectively.

Critical Points of the Dynamical System
We assume that the Lyra term satisfies ΩLyra ≡Ω2
β, which ensures algebraic consistency
among the equations. The last two differential equations can then be written as

At any equilibrium, each prefactor or bracket must vanish. Hence, a fixed point must satisfy
Ωβ = 0 or F = 0,
ΩV iscous = 0 or G = 0.
Since G −F = 2, both F = 0 and G = 0 cannot hold simultaneously. Below we list all
admissible families of equilibrium points under this constraint.
3.1.1
Family I: ΩV iscous = 0 (vanishing viscous component)
In this case G = 1 + Ω2
β + x2 −y2. The conditions dΩβ/dN = 0 and dy/dN = 0 give

Physical significance (interpretation of these four branches)
• All four points lie in the subspace where the Lyra displacement and viscous fraction
vanish: ΩLyra = Ω2
β = 0, ΩV iscous = 0. Thus they are pure scalar-field equilibria:
the cosmic dynamics at these points is controlled solely by the scalar field (kinetic +
potential balance encoded in x, y).
• The two branches with x given by the +Σ formula (points P(+,±)) typically correspond
to one family of scalar-dominated solutions where the sign of y distinguishes expanding
vs. contracting potential contributions (or physically the sign of the scalar field veloc-
ity/potential pairing). The explicit form of y shows dependence on α, δ, γ and encodes
whether potential energy dominates (y large) or not.
• The two branches with x given by the −Σ formula (points P(−,±)) are the comple-
mentary scalar-field roots coming from the other algebraic branch of the quartic/cubic
system. Depending on parameters they can represent:
– Kinetic-dominated like behaviour (if |x| is large and y small) — typically unstable
/ early-time repellers, or
– Potential-dominated (if y large relative to x) — candidates for late-time acceler-
ated attractors.
In order to signify the early stages of universe, we can find a special case:
(i) P : (x, y, Ωβ, ΩV iscous) = (±1, 0, 0, 0),
which exist only if δ = 0. They correspond to a kinetic-energy dominated universe
(weff = 1), typically unstable.
(b) Mixed Lyra–scalar equilibria.

2. −12αδ + γ2(2αδ −δ + γ) −6γ ≥0.
Both conditions must hold simultaneously for a real-valued Pβ.
(If δ changes sign, the
inequality signs must be interpreted accordingly.)
Cosmological Significance
The critical point Pβ represents a dynamical balance be-
tween the Lyra geometric modification and the scalar field evolution in the cosmological
phase space. The absence of viscous contribution (ΩV iscous,c = 0) suggests that this point
corresponds to a stage where the universe behaves as an effective perfect fluid dominated by
the scalar field and Lyra manifold contribution.
Physically, the term Ωβ measures the influence of the Lyra displacement vector on the
cosmic dynamics, while the variables (x, y) represent the kinetic and potential energy com-
ponents of the scalar field, respectively.
The signs of yc and Ωβc correspond to distinct
evolutionary branches:
• The positive branch (xc, +yc, +Ωβc) is typically associated with an accelerating phase
of the universe, where the potential energy dominates and leads to a quintessence-like
behavior.


12
• The negative branch (xc, −yc, −Ωβc) corresponds to a contracting or decelerating phase,
where the kinetic contribution of the scalar field dominates, possibly mimicking a stiff-
fluid or matter-like regime.
The branch Pβ thus describes a cosmological configuration where:
• The Lyra displacement field induces an additional geometric potential that modifies
the late-time cosmic dynamics.
• The absence of viscous effects indicates that dissipation is negligible, corresponding to
a nearly adiabatic universe.
• Depending on the choice of the coupling parameters (α, δ, γ), the point Pβ can represent
either a stable accelerated attractor (dark-energy–like behavior) or a transient scaling
regime where the scalar field energy tracks the background matter content.
Hence, the critical branch Pβ provides a viable geometrically induced dark-energy config-
uration that emerges naturally within the Lyra manifold formulation and can describe both
early and late-time cosmic acceleration depending on parameter tuning.
3.1.2
Family II: Ωβ = 0 (vanishing Lyra contribution)
Now F = −1 −ΩV iscous + x2 −y2 and G = 1 −ΩV iscous + x2 −y2. The conditions G = 0 or
ΩV iscous = 0 yield:
(a) Pure scalar field
Ωβ = ΩV iscous = 0, identical to Family I(a).
(b) Viscous-scaling equilibria.
For ΩV iscous ̸= 0, set G = 0 giving
ΩV iscous = 1 + x2 −y2.

Regularity of the original vector field requires x ̸= 0 when ΩV iscous ̸= 0 (because f1 contains
the term ∝ΩV iscous/x). Eliminating y2 via ΩV iscous = 1 + x2 −y2 gives a single polynomial
equation for x (in general cubic), so the viscous-scaling equilibria are given implicitly by the
real roots xc of that polynomial, with
y2
c = 1 + x2
c −ΩV iscous c,
ΩV iscous c = 1 + x2
c −y2
c.
In other words, the PV points satisfy the above cubic-type algebraic equation and must
be obtained either by exact algebraic root formulas (lengthy closed-form expressions) or
numerically for given parameters (α, δ, γ).
Cosmological Significance of the Family of Critical Points PV
The family of critical
points PV corresponds to a regime in which the cosmic dynamics are dominated by the viscous
component of the dark sector. These points are characterized by the coordinates
PV :
xc = xV ,
yc = yV ,
Ωβ c = 0,
ΩViscous c = 1 + x2
c −y2
c.
Here, x and y represent the dimensionless kinetic and potential components of the scalar field,
while ΩViscous quantifies the fractional energy density of the bulk viscous fluid. The vanishing
of Ωβ indicates that the Lyra manifold correction is negligible at this stage, implying that the
geometry behaves effectively as in standard general relativity but with viscous modifications.
Physical Interpretation
At PV , the dynamics of the universe are governed by an effective
viscous fluid. The nonzero ΩViscous c represents a dominant bulk viscosity contribution, which
acts as an effective negative pressure component. Such pressure naturally drives accelerated
expansion and can mimic the behavior of dark energy. The scalar field variables (xc, yc)
contribute only as subdominant corrections, modulating the effective equation of state.
Effective Equation of State and Cosmic Evolution
At the critical point PV , the total
effective equation of state parameter can be expressed as
weff = x2
c −y2
c −ΩViscous c.
Using the constraint ΩViscous c = 1 + x2
c −y2
c, we obtain
weff = −1,
which clearly describes a de Sitter phase of the universe. This indicates that the PV family
corresponds to a cosmological constant–like state driven not by a true vacuum energy but
by viscous dissipation within the cosmic fluid.


14
Cosmological Role
The family PV therefore represents a class of late-time attractor so-
lutions characterized by:
• Dominance of the viscous fluid sector (ΩViscous c > 0),
• Negligible contribution from the Lyra geometric field (Ωβ c = 0),
• An effective equation of state weff = −1, consistent with dark-energy–dominated ac-
celerated expansion.
Such solutions can describe the transition of the universe from a matter-dominated decel-
erating era to a viscous-fluid–driven accelerated epoch. The damping nature of viscosity also
stabilizes perturbations in the late universe, supporting the interpretation of PV as a stable
attractor corresponding to a viscous de Sitter regime. This branch thus provides a purely
hydrodynamic explanation of dark energy behavior, emerging naturally within the viscous
Lyra cosmological framework.

Stability Analysis: Eigenvalue Approach
Recall the Jacobian entries (with s ≡
p
3/2) derived earlier.
We denote the Jacobian
evaluated at a critical point by Jc and its eigenvalues by {λi}4
i=1.
(A) Kinetic points P1,2 = (±1, 0, 0, 0)
These points exist as equilibria only when the coupling parameter vanishes (i.e. δ = 0).
At P1 = (1, 0, 0, 0) (δ = 0) :
Eigeenvalues
λ1 = 3,
λ2 = sγ + 3,
λ3 = 0,
λ4 = 3.
At P2 = (−1, 0, 0, 0) (δ = 0) :
Eigeenvalues
λ1 = 3,
λ2 = −sγ+3,
λ3 = 0,
λ4 = 3.
Because two eigenvalues equal 3 > 0, both P1,2 are generically unstable (repellers).
(B) Scalar-only branches P(±,±) with Ωβ = ΩLyra = 0, ΩV iscous = 0
Let (xc, yc) denote any root from the algebraic list P(+,+), P(+,−), P(−,+), P(−,−).
At such
points Ωβ = 0, ΩV iscous = 0.
Two of the eigenvalues are given by the Lyra and viscous diagonal entries (they decouple):
λΩβ = 3

λΩV iscous = 3
2(1 + x2

The two eigenvalues λ1,2 in the (x, y) sector are the roots of

∆= AD −BC.
Thus
λ1,2 = τ ±

with A, B, C, D as above evaluated at the chosen branch (xc, yc).
Stability criterion for P(±,±).
• If λΩβ < 0, λΩV iscous < 0 and ℜ(λ1,2) < 0, the point is a stable attractor.
• Mixed signs imply a saddle.
• Presence of any positive real part implies instability.
(C) Lyra–scalar mixed family Pβ (with ΩV iscous = 0 and F = 0)
Lets evaluate the Jacobian diagonal entries for the Lyra and viscous directions:
λΩβ = 3(1 −x2
c + y2
c),
λΩV iscous = 3
2
 1 + (1 −x2

= 3.
Therefore two eigenvalues are λΩV iscous = 3 and λΩβ = 3(1 −x2
c + y2
c).
The remaining two eigenvalues come from the 2×2 (x, y) block evaluated at Pβ. Denoting
those entries by Aβ, Bβ, Cβ, Dβ (forms analogous to the scalar-only case but with Ωβ ̸= 0
substituted). Their characteristic polynomial again reads
λ2 −τβλ + ∆β = 0,
τβ = Aβ + Dβ, ∆β = AβDβ −BβCβ.
Thus the two scalar eigenvalues are
λ1,2 =
τβ ±

17
• One eigenvalue equals 3 > 0 (the viscous direction), so Pβ generically has an unstable
direction unless non-generic cancellations occur; this tends to make Pβ a saddle in
many parameter regimes.
• Conclude: Pβ is generically a saddle because of the positive viscous eigenvalue, but
specific parameter tuning may change this outcome (requiring further nonlinear/center-
manifold analysis).
(D) Viscous-scaling family PV (with Ωβ = 0 and G = 0)
Lets evaluate diagonal Jacobian entries for the Ω-directions using Ωβ = 0 and G = 1 + Ω2
β −
ΩV iscous + x2
c −y2
c = 0:
λΩV iscous = −3
2(1 + x2
c −y2
c) = −3
2,
λΩβ = 3
2(−1 −ΩV iscous c + x2
c −y2
c)
Thus two eigenvalues are negative and simple: λΩβ = −3 and λΩV iscous = −3/2.
The remaining two eigenvalues again come from the (x, y) 2 × 2 block evaluated at PV .
Denote its entries by AV , BV , CV , DV (computable by substituting Ωβ = 0 and ΩV iscous =
1 + x2
c −y2
c into the general derivative formulae). Their characteristic polynomial is
λ2 −τV λ + ∆V = 0,
τV = AV + DV ,
∆V = AV DV −BV CV ,
so the scalar-sector eigenvalues are
λ1,2 = τV ±
p
τ 2
V −4∆V
2
.
Stability criterion for PV .
• Two eigenvalues are strictly negative (−3 and −3/2). If ℜ(λ1,2) < 0 as well, then
all four eigenvalues have negative real parts and PV is a stable node/spiral (late-time
attractor) — this is the common viscous-de Sitter attractor scenario.
• If one of λ1,2 has positive real part, PV is a saddle.

Phase Portrait Analysis: Cosmological Stability and
Instability
In this section, we present the global phase portrait evolution and corresponding trajectories
of the cosmological dynamical system under various regimes of the interaction and viscous


18
parameters. Each portrait illustrates the evolution of the system in the (x, y)-plane and the
corresponding cosmological density parameters Ωm, ΩLyra, and ΩV iscous as functions of the
e-folding number N. The nature of the critical points and their stability are analyzed for
each case using linear perturbation theory around the equilibrium points.
4.1
Interaction-free and Non-viscous Dark energy Component
For the case γ = −1, α = 1, and δ = 0, both interaction and viscous terms vanish. The
phase portrait in Figure 1 shows symmetric trajectories approaching the central attractor,
indicating a stable configuration where the universe asymptotically evolves toward a Lyra-
dominated de Sitter phase. The trajectories rapidly converge to the equilibrium state, and
ΩLyra →1 while Ωm and Ωϕ decay, implying a dark energy-displacement dominance due to
presence of Lyra manifold geometry. In addition to this, we have two repeller points and
one attractor point. For both repeller points, the speculated scalar potential revolves around
zero. Again for (xc, yc) ≈(0.49, 0.64), which corresponds to a late-time accelerating phase
of the universe with Ωϕ →1 while Ωm and ΩLyra decay.
Moreover in the evolution part (right panel), we can observe that in the early universe
(N ≈−5) dominance of Lyra displacement is visible, after that gradually matter dominance
begins almost from N ≈−2.5.
Dark energy component grows at N ≈−2 as well as
matter component decreases and gradually and it overtakes the matter component.
At
present (N = 0), graphs shows Ωϕ = 0.65, Ωm = 0.27. In future if there is no interaction
happened between non-viscous dark energy and mass-varying dark matter, dark energy will
fully dominate as a result universe will expand exponentially.
Figure 1: Phase portrait and corresponding evolution of cosmological parameters for γ =
−1, α = 1, δ = 0 with initial values x(0) = 0.18, y(0) = 0.73, Ωβ(0) = 0.065, Ωviscous(0) = 0.
The system evolves toward a Lyra-dominated stable attractor.


19
4.2
Interaction-free and Low Viscous Dark Energy
When a small viscous component is introduced (ΩV iscous(0) = 0.01), the phase portrait
(Figure 2) reveals slightly distorted trajectories, but the system still converges toward a
stable attractor.
The damping due to viscous dark energy slightly modifies the rate of
convergence. There are four critical points in the viable region: two attractor and and two
saddle points. Hence, the critical point with scalar potential yc > 0 i.e, (xc, yc) ≈(0.56, 0.82)
remains stable, representing a universe evolving to a quasi–de Sitter attractor with small
dissipative corrections.
In the evolution part (right panel), due to viscous property of dark energy dark matter is
comparatively suppressed and indicating a present situation where Ωm = 0.13 and Ωϕ = 0.88.
Figure 2: Phase portrait and cosmological evolution for γ = −1, α = 1, δ = 0, x(0) = 0.32,
y(0) = 0.86, Ωβ(0) = 0.065, Ωviscous(0) = 0.01.
Weak viscosity leads to damped stable
trajectories.
4.3
Small Interaction and Non-viscous Dark Energy
Introducing a small interaction (δ = 0.07) while keeping ΩV iscous = 0 results in more dynamic
trajectories (Figure 3). Two distinct families of critical points appear — one unstable (saddle-
like) near (x, y) ≈(0, 0) and one stable node near (x, y) ≈(0.4, 0.8). The interaction term
shifts the source of attraction, allowing transient matter-dominated evolution before settling
to the Lyra field attractor. Hence, the phase space consists of both transient (unstable)
and asymptotically stable domains, representing a transition from matter-dominated era to
energy dominance in the background of the Lyra manifold.
In addition, the cosmological evolution panel shows that dark matter increased in density
just before the present era due to the small interaction introduced and ended up taking a


20
higher value in the present situation. Again, the equation of state for dark energy (ωeff)
will blow up beyond the phantom barrier in the near future.
Figure 3: Phase portrait and parameter evolution for γ = −1, α = 1, δ = 0.07, x(0) = 0.16,
y(0) = 0.81, Ωβ(0) = 0.06, Ωviscous(0) = 0.
Weak interaction shifts the stability basin,
yielding one stable and one saddle point.
4.4
Small Interaction and Low Viscous Dark Energy
For small interaction and weak viscosity (δ = 0.07, ΩV iscous(0) = 0.01), the portrait in
Figure 4 shows smoother spiraling trajectories approaching a stable focus. The combined
damping from interaction and viscosity reduces oscillatory motion, producing a globally
stable attractor. Hence, the system exhibits oscillatory convergence toward the de Sitter
state, implying a stable late-time cosmological configuration.


21
Figure 4: Phase portrait and cosmological evolution for γ = −1, α = 1, δ = 0.07, x(0) = 0.19,
y(0) = 0.76, Ωd(0) = 0.13, Ωviscous(0) = 0.01. Both weak interaction and viscosity yield a
globally stable focus-type attractor.
4.5
Substantial Interaction and High Viscous Dark Energy
In the regime of strong coupling between the dark energy and highly mass-varying dark
matter, along with significant bulk viscous effects of dark energy, the dynamical behavior
becomes more complex.
For the parameters γ = −1, α = 1, δ = 0.07 and the initial
conditions x(0) = 0.38, y(0) = 0.81, Ωβ(0) = 0.1, and Ωviscous(0) = 0.1, the system demon-
strates the combined influence of strong viscous energy and interaction. The phase portrait
in Figure 5 exhibits multiple families of trajectories converging toward dominant attrac-
tors. Compared to the weak-viscosity cases, the trajectories are heavily damped and show
minimal oscillations. This indicates that viscosity now plays a leading role in dissipating
dynamical fluctuations, suppressing any transient oscillatory modes that might have existed
in the weakly interacting cases.
From the cosmological parameter evolution (right panel), Ωϕ gradually dominates as N
increases, while Ωm and ΩLyra asymptotically approach small constant values. This behavior
corresponds to a late-time accelerating phase where Lyra geometry drives the expansion but
with residual energy contributions from matter and viscous effects. For this case, Ωm does
not vanishes due to sufficient interaction in the dark sector.


22
Figure 5: Phase portrait and corresponding evolution of cosmological parameters for γ = −1,
α = 1, δ = 0.07, with assigned initial values x(0) = 0.38, y(0) = 0.81, Ωd(0) = 0.1, and
Ωviscous(0) = 0.1. Strong coupling and viscosity enhance damping and alter the basin of
attraction.
The strong dissipative regime ensures that any deviation from the equilibrium is rapidly
suppressed, yielding a globally stable cosmological phase. Such a configuration represents a
universe dominated by Lyra dark energy with minimal dynamical feedback from the interact-
ing matter and viscous sectors. This regime thus corresponds to a robustly stable late-time
de Sitter attractor, ensuring the asymptotic stability of the cosmic dynamics.
4.6
Overall Summary of the Dynamical Regimes
The five dynamical regimes presented in Figures 1–5 represent a systematic exploration of
the cosmological system under varying interaction strengths (δ) and viscous effects (Ωviscous).
Each regime captures a distinct phase of the universe’s evolution in the framework of Lyra
geometry and presence of coupling viscous dark energy and mass-varying dark matter. The
combined analysis of phase portraits and time-evolution plots reveals the transition from
unstable early-time expansion to stable late-time acceleration as dissipation and interaction
are gradually introduced.
The systematic progression from Regime 1 to Regime 5 demonstrates how the inclusion
of interaction (δ) and viscous effects enhances the dynamical stability of the cosmologi-
cal model. While the null cases describe unstable or transitional early-time dynamics, the
strongly interacting and viscous cases produce a stable de Sitter attractor consistent with
observational late-time acceleration. Thus, viscosity and interaction play complementary
roles: viscosity damps dynamical fluctuations, while interaction promotes geometric-matter
energy exchange that drives the universe toward a Lyra–dominated equilibrium.

Table 2: Summary of stability and cosmological interpretation for different interaction–
viscosity regimes.
We extend our analysis by examining the behavior of the stable points under the variation
of the viscous parameter δ. Figure 6 shows how these points change in the (x, y) plane for
different values of δ, while keeping the other model parameters fixed at α = 1.0, γ = −1.0,
Ωβ0 = 0.13, and Ωvis0 = 0.01. Different colors represent the values of δ, which increases from
violet to red, as indicated in the colorbar.
The red dots close to the origin (0, 0) indicate the stable points of the system among the
total six stable points, that do not move significantly with the change in δ. However, as δ
increases, the coordinates of the other four critical points shift along the plane, showing that
the position and stability of the equilibrium states depend strongly on the viscous parameter.
Two of the stable points lie near the y-axis but are located away from it, while the remaining
stable points on the x-axis gradually move toward higher positive x values as δ increases.
This behavior suggests that stronger viscous effects lead to a more prominent response in
the Universal dynamic and modify the overall stability structure of the model.
Overall, this analysis shows that the viscous parameter δ plays an important role in de-
termining the evolution of the system.
Even small changes in its value can modify the
phase-space configuration and influence the late-time behavior of the cosmological model.

Summary and Conclusion
In this study, we have carried out a detailed dynamical systems analysis of a cosmological
model incorporating a Lyra geometric displacement field, a canonical scalar field and a bulk
viscous dark energy component interacting with mass-varying dark matter. Our investigation
demonstrates that the interplay of Lyra geometry and viscous effects provides rich dynamical
behaviors capable of explaining both early- and late-time cosmic evolution within a unified
framework. The critical point analysis reveals several distinct equilibrium configurations rep-


27
resenting different cosmological epochs. The kinetic-energy–dominated points (P1,2) behave
as early-time repeller states, consistent with stiff-fluid–like expansion scenarios (weff = 1)
in the primordial universe [50]. The scalar-field–dominated branches (P(±,±)) contain both
saddle and attractor solutions, with certain roots leading to potential-dominated accelerated
expansion reminiscent of quintessence-driven de Sitter behavior [51, 52]. These solutions
align with the theoretical requirement that dark energy must dominate at late times, driving
cosmic acceleration as supported by observational data from Supernovae Ia, CMB (Planck
2018), and BAO surveys [55, 53, 54]. The Lyra–scalar mixed branch (Pβ) demonstrates
how geometric modification through the Lyra displacement field acts as an effective cosmo-
logical term [56]. Although typically saddle-like, this branch contributes a viable transient
stage connecting matter and dark energy phases. Most notably, the viscous-scaling family
(PV ) emerges as a dynamically robust late-time attractor, where viscous dark energy drives
an effective equation of state weff ≈−1, enabling de Sitter expansion without invoking an
explicit cosmological constant. This connects well with the idea that dissipative processes
such as bulk viscosity could act as a natural mechanism behind dark energy and cosmic
acceleration [57, 58]. The phase portrait analyses reinforce these findings, showing smooth
transitions from matter-influenced epochs toward stable attractor solutions characterized by
accelerated expansion. Weak viscosity and interaction maintain a de Sitter–like regime with
mild damping, whereas strong viscous effects suppress dynamical oscillations rapidly, leading
to a globally stable and observationally compatible accelerating universe. The model further
indicates that residual matter and Lyra geometric contributions may persist at small but
non-vanishing levels in the far future, consistent with dynamical dark energy expectations.
The obtained results highlight that Lyra geometry in conjunction with viscous dark energy
provides a physically compelling framework capable of addressing key cosmological phenom-
ena, including past deceleration, current acceleration, and asymptotic stability of the cosmic
dynamics. Future work may incorporate perturbation analysis and observational constraints
to refine parameter ranges and explore signatures distinguishable from the ΛCDM paradigm.
We further constrain the model parameters by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analysis using a combined set of low-redshift cosmological observations—namely,
the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae compilation [59], Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)
measurements [60, 61, 62, 63] and the SH0ES Hubble constant prior [64]. The likelihood
is built through the total χ2 function combining these observed datasets and the numerical
evolution of the model equations.
The posterior distributions of the model parameters are illustrated in Fig. 7. The best-
fit values obtained (see Table 3) are α = 0.10+0.02
−0.02, γ = −0.01+0.02
−0.02, log10 δ = −2.00+0.03

−0.01, log10 Ωβ0 = −3.00+0.08
−0.08, and
log10 Ωvis0 = −3.18+0.03
−0.03.
These values of the model parameters agree well with current


28
cosmological observations.
Our analysis shows that the model can describe the present
expansion rate of the Universe and remains consistent with low-redshift observational data.
The interaction parameter γ is small and negative, which indicates that there is a weak
transfer of energy from dark matter to the viscous dark energy component. This energy
exchange, along with the effect of bulk viscosity, helps the Universe accelerate at late times
without needing a separate cosmological constant. The estimated Hubble parameter h0 also
matches well with the local SH0ES result, suggesting that including viscosity in the dark
sector may help reduce the difference between local and global measurements of H0. Overall,
our results show that viscous dark energy models in the Lyra manifold give a stable and
realistic description of the Universal evolution and are consistent with current observations.
