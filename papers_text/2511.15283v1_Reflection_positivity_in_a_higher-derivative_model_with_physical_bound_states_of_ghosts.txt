Abstract
The inclusion of higher derivatives is a necessary condition for a renormalizable
or superrenormalizable local theory of quantum gravity. On the other hand,
higher derivatives lead to classical instabilities and a loss of unitarity at the
quantum level. A standard way to detect such issues is by examining the re-
flection positivity condition and the existence of a Källén–Lehmann spectral
representation for the two-point function. We demonstrate that these require-
ments for a consistent quantum theory are satisfied in a theory we have recently
proposed. This theory is based on a six-derivative scalar field action featuring a
pair of complex-mass ghost fields that form a bound state. Our results support
the interpretation that physical observables can emerge from ghost dynamics
in a consistent and unitary framework.

Introduction
Quantum gravity theories involving higher-derivative fields often suffer from instabilities
at the classical level, which are related to the well-known Ostrogradski instabilities [1].
In their quantum counterparts, these theories typically contain one-particle states with
negative kinetic energy, known as ghosts.
The presence of such particles can produce
undesirable features, such as appearing at infinite times in incoming and outgoing states [2].
Unfortunately, it is unavoidable to introduce higher-derivative terms into the action of
gravity in quantum theory [4], or even at the semiclassical level, where the gravitational field
is a classical background for quantum matter fields [3]. Because of the utmost importance
of the subject in quantum gravity, numerous remarkable attempts have been made to solve
the problem of ghosts using different approaches. Notably, starting from [5, 6], several
studies have explored the possibility that ghosts in renormalizable quantum gravity with
four derivatives might acquire masses with an imaginary component and, hence, become
unstable due to loop corrections. In such scenarios, the ghost mode decays in the distant
future, rendering the S-matrix unitary. Alternatively, there was an interesting proposal [8]
to construct a theory in which massive ghosts are considered alongside the massless and
healthy (i.e., stable) graviton.
However, both ideas can hardly be implemented in the
minimal renormalizable quantum gravity with four derivatives because in this theory there
is not enough room for hosting a consistent subsector of composite of ghost fields.
On the other hand, resolving the problem of ghosts may be simpler in superrenormaliz-
able quantum gravity models that incorporate six or more derivatives [7]. The mass spec-
trum in such models may contain real-mass ghosts accompanied by other massive, healthy
(normal) states.
Alternatively, there might exist ghost states with complex-conjugate
masses. In both scenarios, one can envision a realization of Hawking’s idea [8], where
he speculated that complex-conjugate ghost states might be accommodated in a consistent
quantum theory, provided they remain off-shell and do not contribute to the asymptotic
Hilbert space. In the complex-mass scenario, quantum corrections are unnecessary to ob-
serve the emergence of the imaginary components of the masses, as described in one of
the pioneering papers by Salam and Strathdee [6]. Within the six-derivative (or higher)
quantum gravity framework, the complex-mass poles in the propagator are present already
at tree level and persist under loop corrections [9].
An appealing feature of superrenormalizable theories with complex-mass ghosts is the
possibility that such ghosts do not appear in the asymptotic spectrum but instead form
physical bound states, an idea reminiscent of early proposals in the context of QCD [10]
and in modern QCD-inspired approaches [11]. However, implementing such a mechanism
in quantum gravity is substantially more difficult due to the nonpolynomial nature of the
2


interactions and the presence of higher-derivative couplings, which make the dynamics
more intricate than in typical QCD models. In spite of this, we recently introduced a toy
model [12] that mimics certain features of higher-derivative quantum gravity and exhibits
a bound state formed by complex-conjugate ghost fields. Related approaches exploring
similar ghost-confinement mechanisms have also appeared in [22,23]. In the present work,
we address the question of whether the toy model of forming bound states that was con-
structed as an example in Ref. [12] is a consistent quantum field theory.
Consistent quantum field theories are constrained by a set of basic and fundamental
principles; see, e.g., [13–16] and also [26] for a recent discussion concerning higher derivative
quantum gravity. Among the most relevant principles, one can list the Wightman axioms
in Minkowski space, and in the Euclidean formalism, the Osterwalder–Schrader reflection
positivity condition and the existence of a Källén–Lehmann spectral representation for the
two-point function. Together with certain additional regularity conditions, these require-
ments ensure the construction of the physical Hilbert space and the quantum fields from the
Euclidean Schwinger functions via the Osterwalder–Schrader theorem [13]. The physical
significance of these conditions has been thoroughly discussed in the aforementioned refer-
ences, in particular, in the books [13,15]. Reflection positivity guarantees the positivity of
the inner product in the reconstructed Hilbert space, while the Källén–Lehmann represen-
tation, applicable to both Wightman and Schwinger two-point functions, encodes unitarity
through the positivity of the spectral density. Analyticity, in turn, embodies causality by
enforcing locality and relativistic propagation. Taken together, these conditions guarantee
unitarity, causality, and the probabilistic interpretation of the theory in accordance with
the principles of quantum mechanics. In the present work, we consider the Källén-Lehmann
representation for the bound state and the Osterwalder–Schrader condition of reflection
positivity in the corresponding quantum theory.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section, Sec. 2, is a technical part of the
introduction, as we discuss the link between reflection positivity and the Källén-Lehmann
representation for the Euclidean two-point function. In Sec. 3 we analyze the reflection
positivity condition in the model developed in Ref. [12].
Sec. 4 discusses the Källén-
Lehmann representation. Finally, in Sec. 5 we draw our conclusions.
2
Reflection positivity from Källén-Lehmann representation
Let us start by analyzing the existing relation between reflection positivity and the positiv-
ity of the spectral representation. In particular, we shall show that if a two-point Schwinger
correlation function S2(x−y) satisfies the Källén-Lehmann representation, it automatically
verifies reflection positivity. Reflection positivity implies the positivity of the product in
3


the Hilbert space [26]
⟨θf, S2f⟩=
Z
d4x d4y (θf)(x) S2(x −y) f(y) ≥0 ,
(1)
for any continuous function f ∈C0(R4
+) with compact support in the positive time half-
space (y0 > 0) of R4, where θ is the time-reversal transformation defined by (θf)(x0, x) =
f ∗(−x0, x). Assuming a Källén-Lehmann representation for the two-point function
S2(p2) =
Z ∞
0
ds ρ(s)
p2 + s ,
ρ(s) ≥0 ,
(2)
which, after a Fourier transform, reads
S2(x −y) =

ds ρ(s) ∆s(x −y) ,
∆s(x) =

d4p

in a position space representation. Thus, the reflection positivity definition (1) factorizes
as
⟨θf, S2f⟩=
Z ∞
0
ds ρ(s) Is
(4)
where
Is =
Z
d4x d4y (θf)(x) ∆s(x −y) f(y) .
(5)
Since f(y) = f(y0, y) has support only at the half space y0 > 0, which means it is only
non-vanishing for y0 > 0. (here and in what follows, this means the function is defined
to be non-zero in the given region) , and (θf)(x0, x) = f ∗(−x0, x) only for x0 < 0, we set
x0 = −t′ and y0 = t with t, t′ ≥0, such that

Since we have factorized the dot product into a manifestly positive norm, and the Källén-
Lehmann hypothesis requires ρ(s) ≥0, we have
⟨θf, S2f⟩=
Z ∞
0
ds ρ(s) Is ≥0.
(9)
This means that the Källén-Lehmann representation with positive spectral density implies
Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity. It should be remarked that the two-point cor-
relation function satisfies the reflection positivity condition (1), even after the removal of
possible UV divergences, whenever they are associated with local counterterms. The rea-
son is that subtracting a polynomial term in p2 from the two-point function contributes
as derivatives of a Dirac’s delta function in position space. Thus, this operation may add
only contact terms that contribute solely at coincident points x = y, which are outside
the support R4
+ of the f functions. Therefore, reflection positivity is also preserved by the
renormalized two-point correlation functions.

Reflection positivity in the bound state model of complex ghosts
Let us now consider the reflection positivity condition in the model with a bound state
formed by a pair of complex-mass ghost-like elementary quantum states [12]. The starting
point of the model is a six-derivative scalar action with one healthy massless particle and
two particles with complex-conjugate masses. By using Gaussian integration in the free
theory, one can find an equivalent action with three two-derivative scalar fields. Ignoring
the massless part and introducing an interaction term, we arrive at the action
Sgh =
Z

 −∂2 + m2
φ1 −i

φ2 −U(φ1, φ2)

(10)
where we choose the interaction of the form
U(φ1, φ2) = 1
4 λ12 φ2
1φ2
2 .
(11)
5


Here λ12 > 0 is the coupling constant corresponding to the interaction of the two fields.
Let us now explore the composite operator made of the product Oφ1φ2(x) of two ghosts
with complex-conjugate masses
Oφ1φ2(x) = φ1(x)φ2(x) .
(12)
The respective correlation function C(x, y) defines the nature of a possible bound state,
C(x, y) = C(x −y) = ⟨Oφ1φ2(x) Oφ1φ2(y)⟩
=

Dφ1Dφ2 Oφ1φ2(x) Oφ1φ2(y) e−Sgh .
(13)
Using the first order two-point function GB(p)
GB(p) =
Z
d4k
(2π)4 Dφ1(p −k) Dφ2(k) .
(14)
with the elementary propagators
Dφ1(p) =
i
p2 + m2
and
Dφ2(p) =
−i
p2 + m∗2 ,
(15)
we arrive at the momentum representation of the resumed two-point correlation function
(13) in the form
C(p) = GB(p)

n =

(16)
Thus, the fundamental features of (13) depend on the expression for the first order two-
point function (14). This integral can be written in explicit form
GB(p) =
Z

(17)
Our purpose is to explore whether the correlation functions of the composite operator
satisfy Osterwalder–Schrader reflection positivity. In the next section, we will derive an
explicit, renormalized Källén–Lehmann representation for (17), which, by the results of the
previous section, establishes its reflection positivity. Here, however, we provide a direct
and independent proof that does not rely on the Källén–Lehmann representation. Consider
∆m(k) =
1
k2 + m2 =
1
k2
0 + k2 + m2 ,
∆m(x) =
Z
d4k
(2π)4eik·x∆m(k) ,
(18)
the free propagator in momentum space, and its Fourier transform to the coordinate space.
Since GB(p) is a convolution of two free propagators in momentum space, its corresponding
6


Fourier transform to position space GB(x) is the pointwise product and thus we need to
apply the reflection positivity test (1) to the function
GB(x −y) = ∆m(x −y)∆m∗(x −y) .
(19)
Using the well-known Fourier integral
Z dk0
2π
eik0x0
k2
0 + k2 + m2 = e−ωk|x0|
2 ωk
,
ωk =
√
k2 + m2 ,
(20)
the Euclidean free propagator then has the representation
∆m(x) =
Z
d3k
(2π)3

2ωk
eik·x e−ωk|x0| .
(21)
Reflection positivity requires the positivity of the product in Hilbert space
⟨θf, GBf⟩=
Z
d4x d4y (θf)(x) GB(x −y) f(y) ≥0 .
(22)
Since f has support in x0 > 0, the reflected function θf has support only in x0 < 0. Thus,
in the integral (22), it is always satisfied that x0 < 0, y0 > 0. Therefore
|x0 −y0| = −(x0 −y0) = −x0 + y0 = |x0| + y0 ,
because for x0 < 0 we have |x0| = −x0. Now, expanding the bilinear form of reflection
positivity (22) and inserting GB(x −y) explicitly (19), we have
⟨θf, GBf⟩=

(23)
Now let us change the variables u0 = −x0 > 0 and u = (u0, x) with u = x. Then clearly
f ∗(−x0, x) = f ∗(u) and |x0| = u0, so the bilinear form (23) becomes

(24)
Let us introduce the auxiliary function
Fk,q =

(26)

(27)
Since we have been able to write the reflection positivity bilinear form as an integral of
absolute squares with a positive measure, the first order two-point function GB(x −y)
satisfies the reflection positivity property. Note that in the derivation, it is crucial that
the two masses are complex conjugates (to end up with conjugate frequency factors) and
have positive real parts so that the Fourier time-integrals yield decaying exponentials. One
might be worried about the fact that the first order two-point function integral (17) is
divergent at large momentum. Since this UV divergence is logarithmic, the simplest way
to renormalize it is via a momentum subtraction scheme, as was done in [12].
Let us now define the first order renormalized two-point function as
G′
B(p) = GB(p) −GB(p0) ,
(28)
where the subtraction is done at p0 and therefore GB(p0) is a constant independent of p.
In position coordinate space, this renormalized two-point function reads
G′
B(x) = GB(x) −GB(p0) δ(4)(x) .
(29)
It is easy to see that the subtracted first order two-point function G′
B(x) also satisfies
reflection positivity, since by the definition (22) we explicitly have
⟨θf, G′
Bf⟩= ⟨θf, GBf⟩−GB(p0)
Z
d4x d4y (θf)(x) δ(4)(x −y) f(y) .
(30)
The delta function reduces the last integral to
Z
d4x (θf)(x)f(x) ,
but (θf)(x) = f ∗(−x0, x) has support only where x0 < 0, while f(x) has support only
where x0 > 0. Since the supports are disjoint, the delta integral contribution vanishes;
thus,
⟨θf, G′
Bf⟩= ⟨θf, GBf⟩,
and so reflection positivity is preserved for the renormalized first order two-point function.
The crucial point is that subtracting a constant in momentum space corresponds to adding
8


a contact term proportional to δ(4)(x) in position space. This contact term does not con-
tribute to the Osterwalder–Schrader condition for test functions supported in the positive-
time half-space. Thus, reflection positivity is preserved even after renormalization. More
generally, subtracting a polynomial in p corresponds to adding derivatives of delta func-
tions in position space; such contact terms are also invisible to the Osterwalder–Schrader
conditions. This is a consequence of the principle that adding local contact terms does not
change the physical correlation functions away from coincident points.

Renormalized Källén-Lehmann representation
Let us now show that the Euclidean first order two-point function integral (17) also admits
a Källén-Lehmann spectral representation, we need to establish the following relationship
GB(p2) =
Z ∞
0
ds ρ(s)
p2 + s .
(31)
Here, ρ(s) ≥0 must be a positive spectral density function to ensure the unitarity and
causality of the theory. Is it clear that if GB(p2) diverges, just as (17) does, then it is impos-
sible to accomplish such a relation directly. It is usual in such cases to use a suitably sub-
tracted spectral representation to deal with finite quantities. This subtracted/renormalized
Källén-Lehmann representation can be derived by taking the derivative of (31) with respect
to p2 and then integrating from p2
0 to p2, i.e.,
GR
B(p2) = GB(p2) −GB(p2

where now GR
B(p2) is finite. There are several ways of showing that GR
B(p2) has a spectral
representation with positive spectral density. One way starts from the original first order
two-point function expression (17). After analytic continuation to Minkowski spacetime,
we can use Cutkosky cut rules. In this case, the result is almost immediate [17]. The
other way, which we detail here, is based on a method that was used in [18] for the case
of purely imaginary masses. Here, we will apply it to the more general case of complex
masses. We start by considering the derivative of (17) with respect to p2, expressed in
terms of Feynman parameters (the overall factor 1/(4π)2 is omitted for simplicity)

where the second term in the integrand is x = x(α). Note that when solving x in terms of
α, the root with the minus sign in front of the square root is not the appropriate one, as
it does not yield the limiting values x = 0 and x = 1. We are working in Euclidean space
p2 ≥0; therefore, the integral in (35) does not have poles in the upper half-plane but has
a square root branch cut starting from a threshold value αthr. This threshold value is the
value of α for which the square root in the integrand acquires an imaginary part; in the
upper half plane, it is given by

This means that one can transform (35) into an integral over a contour Γ in the upper half

1/|α|2 for large α. Moreover, the integral over the term (α −2m2
I)/2α vanishes because of
Cauchy’s theorem. Therefore, one is left with two integrals (in opposite directions) along
each side of the cut. To perform the integral over the square root more easily, we change

This last expression confirms the well-known result that the integral of a function with

where GB(p2

In Minkowski space, this corresponds, up to a π factor, to the discontinuity of the first order
two-point function GB(p2 = −τ + iϵ) along its branch cut, where it develops an imaginary
part. An easy proof of this general statement can be seen directly from the Källén-Lehmann
representation (31) of a correlator F(p2) and by using the Sokhotski–Plemelj identity:

Once a renormalized Källén-Lehmann representation is obtained for the renormalized
first order two-point function GR
B(p2), it is straightforward to obtain such a representation
for the resumed two-point correlation function CR(p2) defined in (16) with the first order
renormalized function GB(p2). Using the same method that was used to derive the Källén-
Lehmann decomposition of GB(p2), we can obtain the spectral function for CR(p2) by
computing its imaginary part in Minkowski space, as in (41). From the definition of the
correlator, we have

where ρC(s) corresponds to the spectral density of the continuum part (above the branch
cut) of the resumed correlator CR(p2).
An explicit expression for ρC(τ) above (42) is
obtained from the real and imaginary parts of the renormalized expression in Minkowski

Of course, this is not the whole spectral density for the correlator, since by the defi-
nition of CR(p2) we also have an isolated contribution from the pole associated with the
ghost condensate bound state of mass M. The complete renormalized Källén-Lehmann
representation of the resumed two-point correlation function is then

(46)
Here RC is the residue corresponding to the bound state, and s0 is the threshold of a
physical branch cut.
Note that for the noninteracting theory, λ12 = 0, we obtain the
spectral function of the first order two-point function, as it should. Also, the value of s0,
given by (37), can be rewritten as

which generalizes the well-known result of the branch cut for real masses. Using the results
of the first section, as we have obtained a renormalized Källén-Lehmann representation for
the resumed two-point function correlator, we can claim that it also satisfies reflection
positivity, since only a momentum independent subtraction (contact term) is needed to
handle the UV divergence.

Conclusions
We have investigated the consistency of a six-derivative scalar field theory featuring a bound
state formed by a pair of ghost fields with complex-conjugate masses that we have proposed
12


in [12]. We examined whether this model satisfies two fundamental consistency conditions
for a quantum field theory: Osterwalder–Schrader reflection positivity and the existence of
a renormalized Källén–Lehmann spectral representation with a positive spectral density.
We have shown that both conditions are satisfied by the two-point function of the composite
(bound state) operator, indicating that physical observables can consistently emerge from
the underlying ghost dynamics in such a theory. In fact a quantum field theory is not
completely defined until one specifies which are their physical fields. In the present case
they are the composite local fields
Oφ1φ2(x) = φ1(x)φ2(x) ,
Our main goal is to explore the possibility of forming bound states in higher (six or
more) derivative models of quantum gravity, where ghost-like states with complex-mass
poles naturally appear. For this reason, it would be interesting to extend the simplest
toy model Ref. [12] endowed with a mechanism of confining ghosts into bound states by
including more general types of interactions, e.g., those with derivatives, which are typical
for quantum gravity models. One can foresee that the methods of proving the consistency
of the theory with bound states, which we used here for the relatively simple scalar model
with the single quartic interaction term (11), may eventually be used for more sophisticated
models of quantum gravity involving ghosts in a controlled way.
