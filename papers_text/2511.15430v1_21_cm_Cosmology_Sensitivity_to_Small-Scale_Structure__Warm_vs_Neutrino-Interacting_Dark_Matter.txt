Abstract. The 21 cm signal originating from Cosmic Dawn to the Epoch of Reionisation
is highly sensitive to the processes governing star formation in the early universe as well as
new physics. In this work, we focus on the imprint of non-cold dark matter (DM), which
impacts the formation of the smallest halos.
Our goal in particular is to clarify whether
near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will
be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal
warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM (νDM) interactions giving
rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping
between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for
the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that νDM interaction strengths
down to σνDM ∼3 × 10−35 cm2 could be probed by 21 cm cosmology when considering two
populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM. This would allow to either confirm or rule out
a recent claimed preference for a non-zero νDM interaction in Lyman-α data. Furthermore,
we find that HERA will not be able to distinguish between νDM and WDM. In the latter
context, the threshold for detection of νDM interactions translates into WDM with mass up
to mWDM ∼9 keV that could be detected by HERA.

Introduction
With the unprecedented volume and redshift range that will soon be accessible, the 21 cm
signal – arising from redshifted 21 cm line emissions in atomic hydrogen and detectable by
radio telescopes on Earth – is expected to provide a new and unparalleled probe of our
universe at the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR, z ∼5) and Cosmic Dawn (CD, z ∼10 −20) [1].
The current generation of interferometers, such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array
(HERA), now fully deployed [2], is expected in the near future to detect fluctuations in the
21 cm signal through its power spectrum, across the redshift range z ∼5–20. Preliminary
results from HERA, based on data from 71 of its 331 antennas collected over 94 nights, have
already provided the most stringent upper limits to date on the 21 cm power spectrum at
z = 8 and z = 10 [3]. These observations will open a new window on a largely unexplored
era of cosmic history, when the first dark matter (DM) halos were forming.
DM halos are a consequence of the growth and collapse of overdensities in the matter
distribution. Acting as gravitational potential wells, they drive the formation of galaxies and
their subsequent effect onto the late-time universe. Therefore, as 21 cm cosmology experi-
ments will probe the intergalactic medium (IGM), they will additionally indirectly probe the
fundamental properties of DM that can affect the halo distribution. Here, we focus on DM
properties that suppress structure formation on small scales. In particular, thermal warm
dark matter (WDM), produced through relativistic freeze-out in the early universe, can free-
stream out of the shallow potential wells of the tiniest overdensities due to its non-negligible
velocity dispersion at the time of structure formation. As such, WDM represents the standard
benchmark for non-cold dark matter (NCDM), and in particular of free-streaming NCDM.1
1WDM has been long proposed as a solution to some of the small-scale discrepancies between cold-DM-only
simulations and observations of dwarf galaxies [4–7]. Although today the addition of baryonic feedback effects
– 1 –


DM could also suppress structures at small scales due to interactions with light degrees of
freedom. Pressure forces can indeed further dampen the small-scale fluctuations of the matter
density field [15–19] (similarly to the Silk damping on baryons [20]). This effect is referred
to as collisional damping. A variety of such scenarios has been investigated in the literature.
These include interactions of dark matter with photons [16–18, 21–34] as well as with neu-
trinos [16–18, 32, 35–42], and more recently with a dark sector radiation species [21, 43–54].
Probing the abundance and distribution of small-scale structures provides a powerful means
to constrain the fundamental nature of dark matter. In this paper, we investigate whether
a near-future radio telescope array that probes the fluctuations in the 21 cm signal could
help to discriminate between collisionless and collisional damping, focusing on two concrete
scenarios: thermal WDM and neutrinos-dark matter interactions (referred to as νDM in the
following). Here we consider the configuration of the HERA telescope for our forecasts.
On the astrophysics side, efficient galaxy formation scenarios involving molecular cooling
give rise to the earliest luminous objects – responsible for initiating CD at redshifts z > 10
– which could form in halos with masses as low as 105−6 M⊙at z ∼15 [55, 56]. These
are referred to as molecular cooling galaxies (MCGs), while more massive halos which allow
atomic cooling, host atomic cooling galaxies (ACGs) with mass greater than 108M⊙. The
abundance of MCGs, as well as the smallest ACGs, depends on the small-scale matter power
spectrum and thus on the properties of DM. Conversely, the sensitivity of 21 cm cosmology
towards the properties of DM depends on the properties of the first CD galaxies. In this
paper, we will consider two populations of galaxies (ACGs and MCGs) and highlight how
their specific properties can affect the reconstruction of the DM properties and vice-versa.
Lyman-α forest observations set a stringent lower bound on the WDM mass [57, 58] of
mLyα
WDM > 5.7 keV
(1.1)
at 95% confidence level, see Ref. [59]. Other recent constraints on WDM from other probes
can also be found in e.g. [60–62] and references therein. Here we use the exclusion of WDM
with masses mWDM ≲5.7 keV at 95% CL from [59] as a reference. Simultaneously, for the
case of neutrino-DM interactions that are governed by a temperature-independent scattering
cross-section σνDM, an upper limit on the interaction strength of σνDM ≲10−33 cm2 for GeV
DM was obtained in [37] using Lyman-α data and assuming massless neutrinos. This bound
was updated in [40] using CMB and SDSS BAO data and considering massive neutrinos.
The presence of massive neutrinos led to a looser bound of σνDM ≲2.2 × 10−30 cm2 for
GeV-mass DM. Furthermore, using Lyman-α flux power spectrum data, Ref. [41] reported a
preference for a non-zero interaction strength of σνDM ∼3.7 × 10−32 cm2 for GeV mass DM.
Some previous analyses have already investigated the ability of 21 cm data to help improve
constraints on the NCDM models we consider here, namely [54, 63–68] for WDM and [69, 70]
for νDM. Our analysis differs from those either in that we focus on the 21 cm power spectrum
and not the global signal, in the implementation of the NCDM imprint onto the 21 cm signal,
or in the modelling of the astrophysics in that we consider two galaxy populations.
Our
approach to the NCDM implementation is most similar to that of e.g. [54, 64] in that we
use a sharp-k cutoff in the calculation of the halo mass function. In this work, we perform a
statistical analysis by means of Fisher matrix forecasts to assess the sensitivity of HERA to
to the simulations alleviates the tensions [8–14], the WDM model remains a plausible and interesting scenario
due to its simplicity and minimality. Yet, if WDM with a – still allowed – mass of a few keV is to account
for the entirety of the DM in the universe, the introduction of O(1000) extra relativistic degrees of freedom is
required at the time of production.

both scenarios and determine whether it would be possible to distinguish between them if a
signal was detected. To that end, we give thorough attention to the description of the halo
population and the computation of the halo mass function in scenarios with a damped matter
power spectrum. Note, however, that [69], who focused on the 21 cm signal at lower redshift
(with the SKA experiment), already suggested that WDM might closely mimic νDM for
z ≲10, which would make it impossible to distinguish between those scenarios observationally.
The paper is organised as follows.
In section 2, we introduce the WDM and νDM
models and examine and compare the linear matter power spectra obtained in both cases.
In section 3, we relate the power spectrum to the halo distribution and, subsequently, to the
astrophysical sources imprinted on the 21 cm signal. The astrophysical modelling is more
specifically addressed in section 4. We discuss our methodology and results in sections 5
and 6 respectively. Finally, we conclude in section 7. Further technical details are given in
the appendices A to C.

NCDM scenarios and linear perturbations
In this work, we focus on the WDM and νDM scenarios which suppress the linear matter
power spectrum on small scales and hence impact the 21 cm power spectrum by reducing the
population of star-forming halos during cosmic dawn. This section is devoted to the different
damping mechanisms and the introduction of a conveniently defined transfer function. The
impact on the halo distribution and on the evolution of the IGM will be addressed in the next
two sections.
2.1
Thermal warm dark matter
WDM suppresses structure formation on small scales through collisionless damping of the
perturbations.
Particles that kinetically decouple from the thermal bath homogenise the
cosmic fluid by streaming from overdense to underdense regions. The thermal velocity of the
particles determines the comoving free streaming length λfs, below which perturbations are
damped, defined as:
λfs ≡
Z a
akd
da′
a′2H(a′)
p(a′)
p
m2 + p2(a′)
,
(2.1)
i.e. the comoving distance travelled by the DM since kinetic decoupling (kd). This corre-
sponds to the time at which the elastic scattering rate between the DM particles and the
species populating the thermal plasma becomes smaller than the expansion rate. The corre-
sponding comoving wave number kfs = 2π/λfs depends mainly on the mass of the particle,
mWDM. As shown in appendix A.1, (see also e.g. Ref. [58] for a fit on numerical simulations),
it is approximately given by

The ΛCDM+3mν scenario is shown as the black solid line for reference. The matter power spectra of
each of the three scenarios that we consider, WDM, νDM and the fitted transfer function, are shown
as dotted, dashed and solid lines respectively for two values of the cutoff scale λcut = 2 × 10−3 Mpc/h
(red) and λcut = 4×10−3 Mpc/h (yellow). The corresponding mWDM and uνDM are shown in Table 2.
Right: The square root of the ratios between the matter power spectra of the three scenarios shown
in the left plot and the ΛCDM + 3mν matter power spectrum.
This corresponds to the transfer
functions as defined in Eq. (2.5) for i = WDM (dotted) and νDM (dashed) as well as the analytical
expression for the transfer function given in Eq. (2.6) (solid).
where ρc,0 is the critical density of the Universe today and the number of DM degrees of
freedom is taken to be gDM = 2. The free-streaming wavenumber of a 1 keV DM particle is
thus kfs ≃20 h/Mpc. For comparison, the free-streaming scale of a cold dark matter (CDM)
candidate with mass mWDM = 10 GeV that decoupled thermally at a temperature Tkd =
100 MeV is kfs ∼106 h/Mpc [51, 71–73] – five orders of magnitude larger. The effect of WDM
free-streaming on the matter power spectrum, as computed by the public Boltzmann solver
code CLASS [74, 75], is shown in the dotted lines in the left panel of Fig. 1 for mWDM ∼5.1
(red) and 2.8 keV (yellow) in red. It can be seen that the WDM additionally generates acoustic
oscillations at scales k > 2kfs and a dark integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect [76]. Nonetheless, as
shown in the figure, these effects are minor in comparison to the sharp free-streaming cutoff.
In Fig. 1, the case of the CDM and νDM are shown for comparison with continuous black
line and coloured dashed lines respectively, see discussion below.
2.2
Neutrino - dark matter interactions
The pressure induced by neutrino-dark matter interactions balances gravitational forces in
the primordial plasma and prevents the growth of overdensities. This process is similar to
the photon-baryon scattering which kept the baryon density fluctuations oscillating before
decoupling and prevented them from collapsing gravitationally. This results in a suppression
of the matter power spectrum that is referred to as collisional damping. More precisely, all
modes inside the horizon until dark matter-neutrino decoupling or, said differently, below the
diffusion scale set by the interaction efficiency, are damped. For a temperature-independent

scattering cross-section, the interaction strength can be characterised by [17]
uνDM = σνDM
σTh.

mDM
100 GeV
−1
,
(2.4)
where σνDM and σTh. are the DM-neutrino scattering and Thomson cross-sections, respec-
tively while mDM refers to the mass of the interacting DM (which is not assumed to be WDM).
A GeV mass candidate with a νDM interaction strength of uνDM = 3.3 × 10−4, excluded by
the most recent CMB+BAO bound [40] when considering massive neutrinos, corresponds thus
to a scattering cross-section of σνDM = 2.2 × 10−30 cm2 for a GeV DM candidate, as reported
in Sec. 1. Notice that throughout this paper, we assume that all three Standard Model (SM)
neutrinos are massive with the same mass mν = 0.02 eV when considering ΛCDM + 3mν
(CDM for short), WDM and νDM cosmologies.
Interestingly, beyond a mere damping of the matter power spectrum on small scales, the
competition between pressure and gravity further leads to the propagation of dark acoustic
oscillations, similar to the baryon acoustic oscillations. These leave a sizeable imprint at a
scale around the sound horizon of neutrinos at decoupling that is clearly visible in the dashed
lines in both panels of Fig. 1, obtained with CLASS for two different interaction strengths of
uν,DM ∼1.65 × 10−8 (red) and 6.68 × 10−8 (yellow). Although the onset of the small scale
damping looks similar in both the WDM and νDM scenarios, the presence of oscillations in
the latter case may help distinguish them, see e.g. [21, 54, 69].
2.3
Transfer function
The difference between the linear matter power spectrum of a NCDM model and that of CDM
can be encoded in the transfer function
Ti(k) ≡

Pi(k)
PCDM(k) ,
(2.5)
with i = WDM or νDM in this paper. In both scenarios, the transfer function can be fit with
f(k, λcut) ≡{1 + (λcutk)γ}−δ ,
(2.6)
in rather good approximation. The cutoff scale is defined as

(2.7)
see e.g. [7, 25, 57]. Here we take {ai, bi, γ, δ} as free parameters. The functional form of
Eq. (2.7) mainly captures the initial drop in the transfer functions. From the expression in
Eq. (2.2) and assuming that λcut scales as 1/kfs, we expect that aWDM ∼0.05 and bWDM ≃1.2.
Similarly, because the diffusion scale in a coupled fluid is proportional to the square root of
the cross-section, we expect that bνDM ∼0.5. To work in a consistent framework for both
scenarios together, as will be necessary for our analysis (see section 5), we simultaneously
fit all six parameters to the Ti(k) calculated by CLASS according to the method described in
appendix A.2. The best-fit values are reported in Tab. 1 and are in agreement with the above

estimates. Therefore, using this global fit, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between
values of λcut and both mWDM and uνDM.
In the left panel of Fig. 1, we show the CDM + 3mν, WDM and νDM linear matter
power spectra in solid black, dotted red and yellow and dashed red and yellow, respectively.
The solid lines show the fitted transfer function for two values of λcut (or mWDM or uνDM) of
Eq. (2.6) using the best-fit values we obtained. The red and dashed yellow sets of lines refer
to two different values of the cutoff scale λcut, which we either translate to mWDM or uνDM
respectively using Eq. (2.7). In Tab. 2, we provide a conversion between three benchmark
values of λcut used in the plots of this paper and the corresponding mWDM and uνDM. We use
those values to compute the matter power spectrum using CLASS (in the dotted and dashed
cases) or plug them into Eq. (2.6) (in the solid case). The right panel of Fig. 1 shows the
corresponding transfer functions.
In Section 5.1, we will use Eq. (2.7) to ensure consistency in our Fisher matrix sensitivity
analysis across both NCDM scenarios. This approach also allows us to assess whether Eq. (2.6)
adequately captures the relevant features of the WDM and νDM matter power spectra. More
specifically, we will investigate whether the acoustic damping features present in the νDM
transfer function could leave observable imprints in the 21 cm power spectrum as measured
by HERA. Before doing so, in the following sections, we describe our treatment of the halo
mass function. Simulations of the 21 cm signal are performed with a modified version of the
public code 21cmFAST [77] called 21cmCLAST2 [78] with an improved coupling to the CLASS
version including massive neutrino interactions with DM [40]3 and new functionalities. In
the latter framework, we detail the NCDM impact of the suppression of the matter power
spectrum on the 21 cm signal.

Halo mass functions
With the onset of the matter dominated era, under gravitational attraction the initial linear
perturbations begin to grow into the nonlinear regime until they collapse to form virialised
DM halos. Because DM halos become the hosts of galaxies when star formation begins, their
distribution has a strong effect on the 21 cm signal.

3.1
Spherical collapse
The excursion set theory allows to derive an analytical expression for the halo mass function
(HMF) studying the Brownian motion of the linear density contrast, see e.g. Press-Schechter
[79] and Sheth-Tormen [80]. Let us assume that structures form from spherical collapse, when
δw
R, the linear density contrast smoothed over a region of size R using a window function w,
reaches ∆c(z) = δcD(0)/D(z), where D is the growth factor and δc = 1.686. At redshift z
inside a region of variance S0 with average linear density contrast δ0 < ∆c(z), the HMF is
given by

(3.1)
where ρm,0 is the average matter density today and the function Sw : M 7→Sw(R) associates
a halo mass to the variance of the linear matter power spectrum within the given region of
size R. It is defined as
Sw
R ≡
D
(δw

Z
d3k
(2π)3 P(k)| ˆW w
R (k)|2 ,
(3.2)
where P(k) again denotes the linear matter power spectrum of the scenario under study. In
this paper, we set the window function to a sharp-k (w = SK) window function defined as
ˆW SK
R (k) = Θ(1 −kR) .
(3.3)
Note that it is with such a window function that the analytical form of the HMF was ini-
tially derived. We furthermore choose to use the SK window function in this analysis because
it has been shown that in the computation of the HMF, it properly accounts for the presence
of NCDM [81, 82]. The top-hat (TH) window function is usually used a posteriori for CDM,
as implemented by default in 21cmFAST v3, notably because it shows a clear correspondence
between the mass of a halo and its radius, RTH(M), with M = 4/3πρm,0R3
TH. The only
drawback of the sharp-k window function is, indeed, that it does not define a finite volume
in real space. Nonetheless, a simple prescription can be used with the halo radius RSK(M)
to satisfy:
M = 4
3πρm,0(cSKRSK)3 .
(3.4)
An analytic solution for cSK is to define the sharp-k volume V (R) inside a region of radius
R such that W SK
R (0)V (R) = 1, which gives V (R) = 6π2R3 and cSK = (9π2/2)1/3 ≃2.42.
Another solution is to directly rely on fits obtained from numerical simulations. This is the
approach that we use in this work, using the radius-to-mass conversion factor cSK = 2.5
obtained in Ref. [83] from numerical simulation assuming the same HMF as the one used in
our analysis (described in Sec. 3.2). This choice is also in good agreement with the analytical
prescription discussed above (cSK = 2.42).
The importance of the sharp-k window function appears when computing the HMF with
a rapidly varying matter power spectrum [81, 82, 84]. In the case of a sudden depletion on
small scales, when M →0, the variance Sw(M) becomes a constant and the shape of the
HMF is mostly driven by dSw/dM. This derivative is highly sensitive to the exact shape of
any smooth window function. Adopting a window function different from the sharp-k actually
leads to unphysical HMFs. This is discussed in more details in App. A.3.

3.2
Implementation with ellipsoidal collapse
In this work, we do not work with Eq. (3.1) directly as we take into account ellipsoidal collapse.
This leads to a correction factor in the HMF that takes the form of a normalisation factor to
the collapsed fraction (see Ref. [77] for more details). More precisely, this correction factor is
evaluated from the Sheth and Tormen HMF [80] which, for a sharp-k window function, takes
the form:

In the bottom panel of Fig. 2, we show the resulting HMF for CDM (black) and for three
non-zero values of the cutoff scale (purple to yellow colours for increasing λcut or equivalently
warmer or more strongly interacting DM). The HMF in Fig. 2 is computed assuming the
fitted transfer function of Eq. (2.6). The dash-dotted vertical lines in both figures indicates
the halo mass M SK
1/2, which corresponds to a halo of radius RSK = k−1
1/2 in Eq. (3.4), where
k1/2 is the wavemode for which the transfer function is equal to 1/2. Using the best-fit values
from Tab. 1 yields k1/2 = 0.13/λcut. It is visible that the abundance of halos with masses

1/2 becomes significantly suppressed. For completeness, the HMF equivalent to the ones
of Fig. 2 obtained assuming WDM or νDM cosmology are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 10.

NCDM imprint on the 21 cm signal
In this section we summarise the basics of the 21 cm cosmology and introduce the 21 cm power
spectrum that will be the observable of HERA. Then, we discuss the astrophysical modelling
of star formation as implemented in version 3 of 21cmFAST and the degeneracies between
the astrophysical parameters and the WDM or νDM parameters.

The 21 cm signal in cosmology
As the dominant constituent of baryonic matter, hydrogen plays a key role in structure
formation. Tracing its distribution and evolution during cosmic dawn is essential to probe
the astrophysical and cosmological processes that shaped the early universe. A useful method
for this relies on spin-flip transitions between the two ground state energy levels of neutral
hydrogen that give rise to absorption or emission of photons of wavelength ∼21 cm. The
relative occupancy of the two ground state energy levels is quantified by the spin temperature
TS. Processes that affect the spin temperature include the emission and absorption of CMB
photons, scatterings on other atoms and resonant Lyman-α transitions. For the redshift range
of interest, it is given by its equilibrium value that can be expressed as [1]
T −1
S
= T −1
CMB + (xα + xc)T −1
K
1 + xα + xc
,
(4.1)
where TK is the kinetic temperature of the IGM, xc encodes the efficiency of collisions within
the gas and xα the coupling to Lyman-α photons, see also [85]. In this expression we have
made the assumption that the colour temperature is equal to the kinetic temperature Tc = TK
[86].
When the redshifted 21 cm signal is observed in contrast with the CMB background it
can be expressed in terms of the differential brightness temperature as
δT21 ≡(TS −TCMB)
(1 + z)
 1 −e−τν
.
(4.2)
In this expression, τν is the optical depth to 21 cm photons and δT21 ≡δT21(x, z) depends
on the line of sight. To a good approximation, the differential brightness temperature can be
expressed as [87]

Star formation, ionisation and X-ray emission
We model the astrophysics using the implementation of 21cmFAST v3, as described in Ref. [89],
that includes a prescription for both atomic and molecular cooling galaxies. The latter are
expected to be hosted by minihalos. The stellar mass in a halo of virial mass M is parametrised
by
Mi

(4.6)
where i = II, III correspond to PopII or PopIII stars, assumed to be hosted by ACG and
MCG respectively, see e.g. Ref. [56]. f i
⋆is the stellar-to-halo mass ratio. Both f i
⋆and the
fraction of ionising ultraviolet (UV) photons that escape the galaxies, fesc, are parametrised
with a power law [90–92]

in equations (4.10) and (4.12) are similar and mainly depend on the stellar mass distribution
into ACGs and MCGs.
In Tab. 3, we summarise the value of the astrophysical parameters that we consider in
this work. We use the EOS2021 model of Ref. [56] as our reference model, albeit with αII
⋆
changed from 0 to 0.1 to simplify the computation of derivatives in the Fisher analyses. This
model is compatible with the current best constraints on the 21 cm power spectrum [96] and,
– 11 –


according to the authors of Ref. [56], it is in agreement with the optical depth to reionisation
constraint from Planck [97]. The resulting stellar mass distribution of Eq. (4.9) at z = 10
is shown as a function of the halo mass in the top panel of Fig. 2 for CDM (black) and for
three values of the NCDM cutoff scale. For the NCDM curves, we use the fitted transfer
function of Eq. (2.6) as input. At large halo masses, ACGs dominate (dotted lines), while
MCGs contribute mainly at smaller masses (dashed lines), producing two distinct bumps.
The imprint of the NCDM cutoff scales is discussed in the next section.
4.3
Dark matter and astrophysics imprint
The effect of non-cold dark matter is expected to be at least partially degenerate with other
astrophysical parameters, see e.g. [63–66, 70]. More specifically, we expect a change in the
previously defined cutoff scale to at least partially mimic the effects of changes in the as-
trophysical parameters governing the star formation rate and efficiency. In this section, we
illustrate this with the parameters f III
⋆
and αII
⋆. Furthermore, large cutoff scales might prevent
us from efficiently probing MCG parameters, because the abundance of the minihalos in which
they form would be too suppressed, see also [63, 64]. This is already well-visible in the top
panel of Fig. 2, which illustrates the impact of different cutoff scales (coloured lines) on the
stellar mass distribution introduced in Eq. (4.9) with respect to the CDM scenario (black). It
can be seen that increasing values of the cutoff scale λcut (purple to yellow colouring), equiv-
alent to warmer or more strongly interacting DM scenarios, lead to a progressively stronger
suppression of the MCG contribution (dotted lines). The CDM case (black) is recovered in
the limit λcut →0. In the yellow case (λcut = 4 × 10−3 Mpc/h), the MCG contribution is
so suppressed that we will not be able to reconstruct well the associated model parameters.
In this case, we expect λcut to mainly be degenerate with ACG parameters, while for lower
values of the cutoff scale we expect stronger degeneracies with MCG parameters to appear.
Also note that Fig. 2 was made using the fitted transfer function of Eq. (2.6). The slightly
different linear matter power spectra in the WDM and νDM scenarios lead to different halo
mass functions, which is illustrated for two values of λcut = {1 and 2} × 10−3 Mpc/h in the
appendix in lower panel of Fig. 10. More concretely, the additional power on small scales in
the linear matter power spectrum in the νDM scenario (compare Fig. 1) leads to an increased
abundance of small halos compared to the WDM scenario, as visible in the upper panel of
Fig. 10. This in turn leads to an increased MCG stellar mass distribution, although this
effect is subdominant w.r.t. the overall suppression of the MCG contribution induced by the
NCDM.
In Figs. 3 and 4, the evolution of the 21 cm power spectrum at k = 0.20 h/Mpc (upper
panel) and of the sky averaged brightness temperature (lower panel) is shown as a function
of redshift. The light and dark gray shaded bands show the experimental uncertainty at 68%
and 95% CL for the reference model (with no NCDM cutoff) under the assumption of 20%
modelling error, see Sec. 5.1 for more details. Each plot explores different values of some of
the model parameters that are expected to show degeneracies between each other.
Figure 3 illustrates that an increase in λcut, or equivalently an increase in uνDM or a
decrease in mWDM, effectively delays the evolution of the differential brightness temperature
and the 21 cm power spectrum, with each of their features appearing at later times. This
happens because larger cut-offs suppresses the matter power spectrum on larger scales, which
reduces the abundance of low-mass halos (as visible in the lower panel of Fig. 2).
As a
consequence, the production of Lyman-α, X-ray and UV photons that drive these features is
diminished and postponed.

A reduced stellar-to-halo mass ratio in MCGs, meaning a lower f III
⋆, results in a decreased
energy injection into the IGM from the lowest mass halos and similarly causes a delay in the
features in the power spectrum, as is visible in the left panel of Fig. 4. Conversely, a large
positive value of αII
⋆, which controls the dependence of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio on the
– 13 –


halo mass in Eq. (4.7), would analogously decrease the relative contribution of low-mass halos
to the signal by suppressing the relative contribution to the Lyman-α, X-rays and ionising
flux of low-mass halos. Increasing αII
⋆would also shift the 21 cm signal towards later times,
as shown in the right panel of Fig. 4, thereby also mimicking the effect of an NCDM cutoff
scale, albeit less significantly. Further discussion of the degeneracies between astrophysical
parameters and the NCDM cutoff scale is provided in Sec. 6.2 in the context of the analysis
our results.

Analysis
We estimate the sensitivity of the completed HERA telescope to both the WDM and νDM
scenarios as well as a scenario using the fitted transfer function, assuming 1000 hours of
observation. To that end, we perform a Fisher matrix forecast using the same tools as in
Ref. [98]. In the following, we detail our application of the Fisher matrix formalism to this
work and discuss our results.
5.1
Fisher matrices
The Fisher information matrix for a set of parameters {θi} is defined as
Fij ≡−EO

∂2
∂θi∂θj
ln L(O | θ)
 θ

,
(5.1)
where L is the likelihood of the observed data given a model and EO the associated expectation
value. The minimum covariance of two parameters can then be estimated as cov(θi, θj) =
(F −1)ij at the Cramer-Rao bound [99–101], and thus the minimum marginalised standard
deviation on a single parameter θi as σi = [(F −1)ii]1/2. Assuming a Gaussian Likelihood, we
compute Fisher matrix elements as detailed in Ref. [98] as
Fij =

.
(5.2)
The sums run over all the wavenumber k and redshift z bins, the observable in this case is
O = δT
2
21∆2
21 and for the measurement error we assume:
σ2
21(ik, iz) = σ2
exp(ik, iz) + σ2
shot(ik, iz) + [ε × O(ik, iz)]2 .
(5.3)
The first term accounts for the experimental error (i.e. thermal noise) and is evaluated using
the public Python package 21cmSense4 [102, 103], the second term accounts for shot noise in
each bin and the third term accounts for the modelling error on O. For the latter, a common
practice in the field is to use ε = 0.2 [89]. However, we will find that the reconstruction error
and detection threshold that we derive for the cutoff scale will depend strongly on the choice
of ε. We will thus also consider the case where ε = 0, i.e. no modelling error.
Using the Fisher matrix formalism, the sensitivity of HERA to our NCDM scenarios
can be evaluated in several ways. One approach would be to estimate bounds on the WDM
particle mass and νDM interaction strength from the 21 cm power spectrum, assuming CDM
as the fiducial model, as done in e.g. Ref. [98] for decaying DM. However, for non-cold dark
matter, this method is hindered by the locality of the Fisher matrix formalism, which relies on

linear extrapolations around the fiducial point. From the discussion in Sec. 4.3, we know that
the NCDM suppression of low mass halos can mimic the effect of the threshold for star forming
galaxies, particularly the one of minihalos set by M III
turn. Yet, once the NCDM cutoff scale is
small enough to significantly suppress the formation of halos of mass M < M III
turn, the 21 cm
power spectrum becomes largely insensitive to variations in λcut. The effect becomes indeed
screened by M III
turn. As a result, taking CDM as the fiducial model (or equivalently λcut →
0) would lead to small corresponding Fisher matrix elements, resulting in large forecasted
uncertainties and artificially weak constraints.
In this work instead, we compute the Fisher matrix elements for a series of fixed NCDM
parameters (λcut, mWDM or uνDM) and determine for which fiducial value of those parameters
we can claim a detection with a certain confidence level. As a result, we report a detection
threshold and not a constraint. Nonetheless, specific attention is required to derive meaningful
detection thresholds that can be compared between the two different NCDM models. Indeed,
the posterior distribution for WDM mass and νDM interaction strength are certainly not both
Gaussian (and most likely none of them really is). Therefore, we cannot simply perform two
independent Fisher analysis for the two scenarios and use the Fisher estimator of the standard
deviation to obtain 95% CL intervals that can be compared together. The different shapes of
the posterior can strongly bias the result. This issue is discussed in details in appendix C.1,
and, in a different context, in e.g. [104, 105].
To enable direct comparison between WDM and νDM scenarios, we adopt λcut as the
universal input parameter for all simulations, that is converted to either mWDM or uνDM using
the fit of Eq. (2.7) when relevant. The resulting quantity is then used as input for CLASS
to compute the transfer function Ti(k), which is passed to 21cmFAST. More precisely, this
conversion and communication pipeline is automated through new functions and interpolation
tables implemented in the wrapper of 21cmCLAST. The input dictionary for CLASS is generated
directly from the 21cmCLAST input object; CLASS is then called via its python wrapper, and
the resulting transfer function is reformatted and passed to the C code for computing the
evolution of the IGM. As a result, the user simply needs to specify the desired value of λcut
in the standard CosmoParams object and select one of the following methods:
1. use λcut directly in the fitted transfer function expression of Eq. (2.6), which is then
applied to the CDM matter power spectrum as computed by CLASS,
2. convert λcut to a WDM mass, which is then input into CLASS to obtain the WDM matter
power spectrum,
3. convert λcut to a νDM interaction strength, which is then input into CLASS to obtain
the νDM matter power spectrum.
5.2
Confidence intevals
In all three scenarios, 1-3, λcut remains the input parameter of the overall call. To derive
confidence intervals, we assume the Cramér-Rao bound is saturated, so that the Fisher matrix
is equivalent to the inverse of a covariance matrix. Under this assumption, one can directly
associate a multivariate Gaussian distribution with the parameters – details of the numerical
evaluation of the Fisher matrix are given in appendix C. However, we also need to take into
account that λcut cannot be negative, i.e. enforce a (flat) prior λcut ∈[0, ∞) while keeping
the posterior normalised. We thus take the marginalised posterior of λcut to be given by a

We can now introduce a confidence interval at confidence level α by solving for δλ in

(5.5)
If we find that δλ < λfid
cut, then the confidence interval is [λfid
cut −δλ, λfid
cut + δλ] and is thus
symmetric with respect to the fiducial value. This corresponds to a detection of λcut (or the
associate DM mass or interaction strength depending on the chosen model) at confidence level
α. On the contrary, if δλ ≥λfid
cut, the confidence interval is [0, λfid
cut + δλ] and we only obtain
an upper limit on λcut.

Results
In this section we present the results of our Fisher matrix analysis, performed as described in
Sec. 5 under the assumption of the astrophysical model parameters given in Tab. 3 and the
fully built HERA telescope with 1000 hours of observation. We first report on the forecast
for the detection threshold of λcut in Sec. 6.1. In particular, the marginalised posteriors of
the reconstructed λcut normalised to their fiducial values are shown in Fig. 5. We further
comment on degeneracies between astrophysical and NCDM parameters in Sec. 6.2 with the
two-dimensional posteriors of a selection of parameters shown in Fig. 6. Finally, we discuss
the difficulty to distinguish between the WDM and νDM models in Sec. 6.3 and provide a
∆χ2 estimate of the capacity of a "test" WDM scenario to account for a "true" νDM scenario.
6.1
Detection threshold
Figure 5 shows the marginalised posteriors of the reconstructed value of λcut, normalised to
the respective fiducial value λfid
cut, as a function of λfid
cut. The dark shaded areas correspond
to 68% CL contours while the pale shaded ones denote the 95% CL contours. To obtain the
results, the transfer function fit of Eq. (2.6) is applied directly to the CDM matter power
spectrum following method 1. The markers show the obtained constraints at 68% and 95%
CL for each evaluated λfid
cut and the error we associate to each confidence interval, following
the prescription given in appendix C.2. In the left panel, we assume a 20% modelling error
(ε = 0.2), while in the right panel we neglect the modelling error, which greatly improves the
value of the detection threshold.
Indeed, with ε = 0.2, we find that HERA could make a detection at 95% CL of cutoff
scales up to λcut ∼2 × 10−3 Mpc/h. This detection threshold corresponds to the smallest
value of λfid
cut for which the reconstructed 95% confidence interval does not include λcut = 0.
This corresponds to WDM with a mass of mWDM = 5.1 keV or νDM interactions with an
interaction strength of uνDM = 1.7 × 10−8. When assuming no modelling error (ε = 0), we

find that the detection threshold reduces to λcut ∼1 × 10−3 Mpc/h, which corresponds to
mWDM = 9.3 keV or uνDM = 4.1 × 10−9. The strong improvement of the detection threshold
with decreased modelling error is to be expected. In the redshift bins with 5 ≲z ≲7.5,
the total noise in the lowest, most sensitive k-bins is strongly dominated by the modelling
noise, which makes any results derived under the assumption of significant modelling noise
rather sensitive to the value of ε. We also find that the detection thresholds we obtain are
independent of the choice of input method (1-3). This implies that the presence of acoustic
oscillations in the νDM case does not impact the 21 cm power spectrum enough to lead to
a different detection threshold. We comment further on the ability to distinguish νDM from
WDM in the data in Sec. 6.3.
The 21cm cosmology forecasts are expected to be sensitive to the astrophysical model,
see e.g. [64, 96, 98, 106–110] who studied the impact of the astrophysical modelling onto the
21 signal or onto the reconstruction of the parameters shaping this signal, potentially including
exotic DM physics. In particular, increasing LX and E0 to larger values could give rise to a
smoother 21 cm signal and thus a more suppressed power spectrum that might become more
difficult to probe and make it more difficult to extract DM properties [64, 98, 111]. In this
work we find that our results do not change significantly when varying the X-ray parameters.
We have varied LII
X = LIII
X between 1041 and 1040 erg s−1 M−1
⊙yr, as allowed by the existing
HERA data [3, 96], and increased E0 up to 1.1 keV. While the individual confidence intervals
– 17 –


of λcut for the same λfid
cut varied by up to ∼15% between models, this did not affect the
obtained detection thresholds at the level of the resolution that we have, even in the case
where we set ε = 0.
In the case of WDM and for ε = 0.2, the obtained WDM mass threshold for detection
is already disfavoured by Lyman-α data, see [59] and the discussion in Sec. 1. On the other
hand, in the case of νDM, the authors of [41] claimed a preference for νDM interactions
with uνDM ∼5.5 × 10−5, corresponding to σνDM ∼3.7 × 10−32 cm2 for DM with a mass
mDM = 1 GeV, using CMB, BAO and Lyman-α data. This would result in a cutoff scale
similar to that of WDM with a mass of mWDM ∼0.4 keV. As this is already strongly excluded
by a variety of data, the authors argued that the extra features in the matter power spectrum
imprinted by νDM interactions could be at the origin for this preference. In our analysis,
we find a direct correspondence between the forecasted HERA detection thresholds for uνDM
and mWDM. Therefore, even if HERA should not be able to constrain WDM more than it
already is by Lyman-α data when considering 20% modeling error, it should still improve on
the detectability of νDM with a detection threshold at uνDM = 1.7 × 10−8. As this is orders
of magnitude below the asserted preferred value of uνDM, HERA should thus easily be able
to confirm or disprove the claim. Accounting for the difference in methodology and telescope,
our results are in good agreement with Ref. [70], which reported forecasted constraints at the
level of uνDM ≤6.6 × 10−7 and Ref. [69], which estimated constraints of mWDM ≥4 keV and
uνDM ≤3.6 × 10−8 for 1000 hours of observation time with SKA.
In this work, in the most optimistic scenario, neglecting any modelling error on the
signal (ε = 0), we find that HERA forecast should probe WDM masses up to mWDM ∼
9.3 keV, significantly above the current Lyman-α bound. Bearing in mind the differences
in methodology, astrophysical model and potentially 21 cm simulator, this is in line with
the results of [63, 64]. Within the same framework, νDM interactions could be probed for
interaction strengths down to uνDM ∼4.1 × 10−9.

Astrophysics-DM Degeneracies
Figure 6 shows the marginalised one- and two-dimensional posteriors at 95% CL for a selection
of astrophysical parameters that are expected to show some level of degeneracy with λcut, see
the discussion in Sec. 4.3. Here again we assume the transfer function as the input method
(method 1 above). For completeness, a full plot containing all parameters is available in the
appendix with Fig. 13. The warmer (colder) or equivalently more strongly (weakly) interacting
DM case is shown as a yellow (purple) contour, corresponding to λfid
cut = 4 × 10−3 Mpc/h
(1×10−3 Mpc/h). The intermediate case shown in red corresponds to λcut = 2×10−3 Mpc/h,
which is the smallest detectable cutoff scale at ε = 0.2, as discussed above.
As can be seen, for larger cutoff scales, or equivalently warmer or more strongly in-
teracting DM (yellow), the constraints on the astrophysical parameters related to MCGs in
minihalos become much less stringent. This is well-visible for f III
⋆
in Fig. 6, where the poste-
rior widens significantly for larger λcut (yellow lines). The same behaviour can be observed
for αIII
⋆, fIII
esc and LIII
X in Fig. 13 in the appendix. This is a result of the suppression induced
by the NCDM of low-mass halos and subsequently their impact on the 21 cm signal. The un-
certainties on ACG parameters in contrast decrease if the NCDM suppression is very strong
(large λcut). This is well-visible for αII
⋆in Fig. 6, but also for the ACG parameters f II

(as well as for t⋆and αesc, which in our astrophysical model are shared between ACGs and
MCGs). Conversely, in the "colder" dark matter case (purple), the uncertainty on the MCG
parameters is reduced while the reconstruction of λcut worsens. This also shows in the widen-

cut in Fig. 5 at low λfid
cut. There are thus two competing effects:
when MCGs contribute the most (small λcut, CDM-like), parameters related to those galaxies
can be reconstructed very well and show little degeneracy with λcut, meaning that λcut can
also be reconstructed well. When MCGs barely contribute (at large λcut, NCDM suppressed),
ACG parameters can be reconstructed better. In both of these cases, degeneracies between
some astrophysical parameters and λcut can be reduced (see the yellow and purple contours
in the bottom row of Fig. 6).
In the intermediate regime, astrophysical parameters show stronger degeneracies with
λcut.
This is illustrated with the example of the red curves in Fig. 6, which correspond
to λcut = 2 × 10−3 Mpc/h.
The degeneracies can be understood with the discussion in
Sec. 4.3. We see for example that λcut is positively correlated with f III
⋆, as decreasing the
latter parameter reduces the contribution of MCGs to all forms of radiation and pushes all
features of the 21 cm power spectrum towards later times. This can partially be compensated
by a decrease of λcut, which leads to colder DM and less suppressed MCGs, see Fig. 3. In
contrast, λcut is anti-correlated with αII
⋆.
An increase of αII
⋆indeed leads to an effective
– 19 –


suppression of the contribution of low mass halos w.r.t. to larger ones, see Fig. 4, which can
then partially be compensated by a decrease in λcut.
6.3
Distinguishing WDM from νDM
Another relevant question is, assuming that HERA detects a signal compatible with an NCDM
model, will it be able to discriminate whether it is WDM or νDM? Fisher matrices only allow
us to compare the different values obtained in the two different configurations (WDM or νDM)
for the detection thresholds of λcut. For a given astrophysical model, if these two values are
similar, one can expect the models to be undistinguishable, none imprinting a distinctive
signature. On the contrary, if not similar, one would be able to identify the detected model
in the window of λcut values were one is detectable while the other is not. Yet, this simple
discussion cannot constitute a rigorous argument.
Below we provide a more quantitative
assessment.
Let us assume that one NCDM model is the underlying "true" model of the universe,
and that a given value λcut ̸= 0 is detected. We consider the possibility to interpret the data
within a "test" NCDM model that differs from the "true" model. We want to assess how well
the "test" model fits the data and whether it would induce any bias in the reconstruction of
λcut. To do so, we compute the quantity
∆χ2

cut , λtrue
cut ) ≡

Otrue(ik, iz | λtrue
cut ) −Otest(ik, iz | λtest

where the "true" and "test" models can be either one of WDM and νDM (denoted as "W"
and "ν" for short, respectively), the observable is O = δT
2
21∆2
21, and the measurement error
σtrue
21 (ik, iz | λcut) is computed in each k- and z-bin for the true 21 cm power spectrum. All
model parameters other than λcut are set to the values reported in Tab. 3. Although this
approach suffers from the same shortcoming as the Fisher matrix formalism in that it assumes
a fixed astrophysical fiducial model, it does provide a more concrete estimate of HERA’s
potential to discriminate between the models.
In Fig. 7 we show the resulting values of ∆χ2
W|ν for three different values of λtrue
cut = {1, 2
and 3} × 10−3 Mpc/h (purple, red and orange colours, respectively), where we take νDM to
be the true model and WDM to be the test model. The values of λtrue
cut are indicated with
coloured vertical dot dashed lines. We show the cases where ε = 0.2 (continuous lines) and
ε = 0 (dashed lines). Both cases show a very similar trend. A larger value of ε corresponds
to more noise and thus less discriminatory ability. Furthermore, the value of ∆χ2 decreases
with increasing cutoff scale λtrue
cut , which means that the discriminatory ability between WDM
and νDM decreases when DM is warmer or more strongly interacting. For completeness, we
show a full 2D plot of log10 ∆χ2
W|ν as a function of λtrue
cut and λtest
cut in the appendix in Fig. 12.
One way to quantify the discriminatory ability of HERA is to compute the difference
in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) between the true and the test model. The AIC
is defined as AIC ≡2NDOF −2 ln ˆL, where ˆL is the maximum likelihood and NDOF the
number of degrees of freedom of the model. The relative likelihood of the test model com-
pared to the true model is then given by exp(−∆AICtest|true/2). Under the assumption of
a Gaussian likelihood and given that in our case, the true model perfectly fits the data, the
AIC difference reduces to ∆AICtest|true = min ∆χ2
test|true. We find that already when keeping
the astrophysical parameters fixed, min ∆χ2
test|true ≲O(1) in all cases. This corresponds to
relative likelihoods of the test models of ≳0.6, which indicates no statistically meaningful

In both Figs. 7 and 12, it is visible that for values λtrue

in place of νDM would yield a biased reconstruction of λcut towards smaller values. This can
be understood in that the νDM model gives rise to more power (and thus more formation
of structures) at small scales than WDM, making it more CDM-like for the same value of
λcut and inducing a smaller shift in the 21 cm power spectrum towards later redshifts than
the equivalent WDM model does. The fact that the bias disappears for larger λtrue
cut could be
understood in that for such large values of λtrue
cut , the MCG population is so suppressed that
it cannot significantly impact the 21 cm signal, and no difference appears. Yet, in all cases
represented here the bias is small.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have explored the sensitivity of the near-future radio telescope HERA, that
probes the fluctuations in the 21 cm signal, to two different non-cold dark matter (NCDM)
scenarios. Here we focus on thermal warm dark matter (WDM) and dark matter interacting
with neutrinos (νDM), two NCDM models which exhibit similar but not equal suppressions
of small-scale structure formation. The suppressions are sourced by different physical mecha-
nisms: free-streaming in the case of WDM and collisional damping with acoustic oscillations
for νDM. In Sec. 2, we discuss the WDM and νDM power spectra and the associated transfer
functions, which can be fit in terms of a cutoff scale λcut that directly depends on the NCDM
parameters. These are namely the WDM mass, mWDM, and the neutrino-DM interaction
strength, uνDM. We took special care to self-consistently account for massive neutrinos. The
– 21 –


definition of the cutoff scale allows us to map νDM and WDM onto each other, a process
that neglects the extra power on small scales caused by the dark acoustic oscillations in the
νDM case.
In Secs. 3 and 4, we detail how we derive the halo mass function and the power spectrum
of 21 cm signal fluctuations from the linear matter power spectrum considering two popula-
tions of galaxies, namely ACGs and MCGs. Our reference astrophysical scenario is based
on the EOS2021 best-fit parameters of Ref. [56] and is given in Tab. 3. We make use of the
extended Press-Schechter formalism, using a sharp-k window function, which is well-suited
for NCDM scenarios. In the subsequent description of our astrophysical model, we have in-
troduced the stellar mass distribution, which depends on both the halo mass function and the
efficiency of star formation. We have shown that in the presence of NCDM, the MCG contri-
bution is strongly affected by the NCDM-induced damping of small-scale structures. This is
because MCGs are hosted in minihalos, the abundance of which is significantly impacted by
the NCDM. We further detail the impact of NCDM on the 21 cm signal. As already noted
in previous works, NCDM tends to shift the signal to lower redshift, as all forms of radiation
fluxes shaping the signal are suppressed. The νDM scenario induces a slightly less pronounced
shift than WDM due to the extra power on small scales, yet this effect appears to be minor
for the considered astrophysical framework. We also discuss some of the degeneracies with
astrophysical parameters.
In Sec. 5, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to forecast HERA’s sensitivity to the
NCDM scenarios, assuming 1000 hours of observation, and determine the detection threshold
for λcut. We find that the results are independent of our input method, either using the
WDM (νDM) power spectrum from CLASS with the corresponding mWDM (uνDM) as the
input parameter, or applying directly the featureless fit of the transfer function to the CDM
power spectrum. We also show that the detection threshold strongly depends on the amount
of modelling noise that we assume. For the standard 20% modelling noise, we find that HERA
could detect values of λcut ≈2 × 10−3 Mpc/h at 95% CL, which corresponds to mWDM ≈
5.1 keV or uνDM ≈1.7 × 10−8.
These thresholds are either already excluded by current
Lyman-α constraints in the WDM case or will allow HERA to test recent claims of a non-
zero interaction strength [41] in the νDM case. Under the assumption of no modelling noise,
the detection threshold improves to λcut ≈1 × 10−3 Mpc/h at 95% CL, which corresponds
to mWDM ≈9.3 keV or uνDM ≈4.1 × 10−9. In this optimistic case, HERA would be able
to probe the NCDM scenarios well beyond e.g. current Lyman-α limits. We find that these
results barely change when varying the heating parameters.
We also discuss the degeneracies between NCDM and astrophysical parameters in the
Fisher matrix posteriors, recovering the expected dependencies as discussed in Sec. 4. We
find that when MCGs are strongly suppressed, ACG parameters are well-reconstructed and
degeneracies between those and λcut are alleviated. When MCGs are less suppressed (CDM-
like), MCG parameters are well-reconstructed with little degeneracy with λcut, at the expense
of ACG parameters. In the transitional regime, neither ACG nor MCG parameters can be
reconstructed as precisely and we observe stronger degeneracies between λcut and astrophys-
ical parameters. Finally, we more quantitatively study the capacity of HERA to distinguish
between νDM and WDM through a ∆χ2 test. We confirm that the expected bias in λcut is
non-zero but small when assuming the wrong model in the reconstruction of the cutoff scales
for the value range of interest.
Our results show that, assuming two populations of galaxies, the 21 cm signal has the
power to further probe the properties of NCDM. The constraining power will significantly
– 22 –


depend on the amount of modelling noise that can be reached in the 21 cm signal simula-
tions. Yet, even in the most optimistic scenarios with negligible modelling uncertainty, the
extra power on small scales in the νDM case will unfortunately not allow this model to be
distinguished from WDM.

Cosmology, NCDM and Astrophysics details
Throughout this paper, we use the natural units convention (ℏ= kB = c = 1) and a default
cosmology from Planck 2018 including TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO [97], (h = 0.6766,
Ωbh2 = 0.02242, Ωch2 = 0.11933, σ8 = 0.8102, ns = 0.9665). In addition, we work with
the most up-to-date value of the effective number of light degrees of freedom Neff = 3.044
[112, 113]. Fisher analyses are produced with 21cmCAST5. We use the following parameters
for 21cmFAST: redshift = 3.5, max_redshift = 35, HII_DIM = 200, BOX_LEN = 300, DIM =
800, PERTURB_ON_HIGH_RES = True, PS_FILTER = SHARPK, USE_RELATIVE_VELOCITIES =
False,6 USE_MINI_HALOS = True, USE_MASS_DEPENDENT_ZETA = True, SUBCELL_RSD = True,
INHOMO_RECO = True, USE_TS_FLUCT = True. We also perform all CLASS calculations with
the in-built fluid approximation disabled, i.e. by setting fluid_approximation = 3. Further-
more, note that in this paper the CDM model refers to ΛCDM with 3 massive neutrinos and
that in all cosmologies considered here the three neutrino masses have been set to mν = 0.02
eV.

Free-streaming length
Here we detail how the approximation of Eq. (2.2) for the free-streaming length of the WDM
has been derived. In particular, its definition in Eq. (2.1) is directly related to the induced
cutoff scale in the linear matter power spectrum. After decoupling, the momentum of one
WDM particles follows the FLRW geodesics and evolves as p(a) = pkdakd/a. Replacing this
expression into the definition of the comoving free-streaming length yields

To follow the computation further, one first needs the initial condition at kinetic decoupling

Yet, this would require a consistent implementation of relative velocity feed-
back in a NCDM scenarios.

where N is a normalisation constant. By nature, we must assume that almost all the WDM

The best-fit is found by minimising Eq. (A.10). In the right panel of Fig. 1, we plot the
transfer functions obtained numerically from CLASS for WDM (solid coloured lines) and νDM
(dashed lines) together with the fitted expression f(k, λcut) from Eq. (2.6) (dotted lines). For
the fitted transfer function, we use the derived best-fit values of the parameters shown in
Tab. 1. This clearly illustrates the goodness of the fit.

Excursion set formalism and the window function choice: top-hat vs sharp-k
A.3.1
Excursion - set theory in a nutshell
Assuming Gaussian distributed initial perturbations, the excursion set theory relates the
linear matter power spectrum to the halo mass distribution [114–116]. To each region of size
R we can associate a smoothed linear density contrast δR over a window W w
R where w tags
the different possible window choices, some of which are discussed below. More precisely, we
define
δw

R (k)
(A.11)
where ˆδ (resp.
ˆW w
R ) is the Fourier transform of the density contrast field δ(x) (resp. W w
R ).
The first natural choice of window function is the top-hat, W TH
R (x) = 3Θ(R −|x|)/(4πR3),
which has the Fourier transform

and that defines δTH

as the volume average of the density contrast inside a sphere of radius

In the excursion set approach, counting halos inside a given volume and around a given
point in space can be done by tracking the evolution of δR (until it reaches the linear collapse

This can be seen, in the case of the top-hat, directly from equation (A.12).
This makes the construction of an analytical theory of structure formation with an arbitrary
window function extremely challenging. The only exception is for the sharp-k window function
defined from its Fourier transform in Eq. (3.3). With that choice, Eq. (A.15) reduces to an
integral of ˆδ(k) over k ∈[1/R, 1/(R −ϵ)], completely independent of the associated δSK

obtained from the integral in Eq. (A.11) performed over k ∈[0, 1/R]. The evolution of δSK

A.3.2
The importance of the window function
In order to recover the correct mass function it is necessary to properly evaluate the derivative
of the variance of the matter power spectrum S,
S′(R) ≡dS
dR =
Z
d3k
(2π)3 P(k)d| ˆWR(k)|2
dR
.
(A.16)
In the following we introduce the dimensionless matter power spectrum Pm(k) = k3P(k)/(2π2).
Moreover, because the Fourier transform of the smoothing window is a function of the prod-
uct kR, it is possible to introduce the reduced window function w : x 7→w(x) = ˆWR(x/R),
independent of R, such that the variance takes the simple form
S′(R) = 1

Depending on the shape of the window function this integral may give a different result. To
quantify this effect, let us define the family of valid window functions,
wϵ : x 7→wTH(ϵx)

parametrised by ϵ ∈(0, 1], and where wTH is the usual top-hat window function
wTH : y 7→3
y3 [sin(y) −y cos(y)] .
(A.19)
This set of functions is chosen to provide a continuous interpolation between the top-hat and
the sharp-k, wSK : x 7→Θ(1 −x), window functions as they satisfy the following limits





w1(x) = wTH(x)
lim
ϵ→0 wϵ(x) = wSK(x)
∀x ∈[0, ∞) .
(A.20)
In the left panel of Fig. 8 we show w2
ϵ(x) for selected values of ϵ, while the right panel dis-
plays the absolute value of its derivative, which enters the expression of S′(R). As ϵ decreases
from 1 to 0, the oscillatory pattern characteristic of the top-hat window function gradually
vanishes, and for small ϵ the derivative tends toward a Dirac delta distribution. For ϵ ∼1,
the broad derivative implies that the integral for S′(R) receives significant contributions from
values of the matter power spectrum at k ≪1/R. When the power spectrum is truncated,
this can produce an artificially large S′(R) on scales where the spectrum is nearly zero. Con-
sequently, the value of S′(R) becomes sensitive to the detailed shape of the window function
derivative itself, which lacks physical meaning.
To illustrate the significance of this issue, Fig. 9 shows the behavior of S′(R) as a
function of R and ϵ: for selected ϵ values in the left panel and as a contour map in the right
panel. In the left panel, the solid lines correspond to the exact integration using the matter
power spectrum of a ∼7 keV WDM model (computed from the analytical transfer function)
displaying suppressed power for wave modes larger than k0 ∼7×101 Mpc−1. The dashed lines,
in contrast, assume that the dimensionless matter power spectrum is approximately constant
over the relevant modes and sharply truncated at k = k0. The latter case approximation is
useful as it allows to derive an analytic expression of the derivative of the variance given by
S′(R) ∼P0
R

1 −w2
ϵ(k0R)

,
(A.21)
with P0 a normalisation constant (that should be set here to 12 to approximate the 7 keV
WDM case). Remarkably, this approximation reproduces the exact result particularly well
for large ϵ, highlighting the direct correspondence between the shape of S′(R) and that of
the window function. The right panel further shows that for ϵ ≳0.1, S′(R) remains sizeable
down to R < 10−4 Mpc, even though the matter power spectrum is sharply truncated around
1/k0 ∼10−2 Mpc. Moreover, in that case, the precise amplitude depends sensitively on the
arbitrary choice of ϵ.
In the end, in the main text, we have first re-derived that the vanilla Press-Schechter
halo mass function can only be derived assuming a sharp-k window function. Then, we have
shown here that the halo mass function of a truncated matter power spectrum obtained with
the top-hat window function is driven by the shape of the window function itself. Therefore,
we conclude that the sharp-k window function is the best choice for consistency and accuracy
for our models.

Effect of WDM vs νDM
Here we provide some extra plots illustrating the differences or similarities between WDM
and νDM. The impact of assuming either the WDM or νDM power spectra or the fitted
transfer function as input method 1-3 on the halo mass function and stellar mass distribution
(discussed in Secs. 3 and 4.2) is shown in Fig. 10. We see that the strongest differences start
to appear at low halo masses, which are already significantly suppressed w.r.t. the CDM
prediction.
The impact of using WDM or νDM as the input (method 2 or 3) on the 21 cm power
spectrum is shown in Fig. 11 for the same values of λcut as in the Fig. 3. Here in particular we
show the power spectra for two different values of k = 0.20 h/Mpc (left, as in the top panels
of Figs. 3 and 4) and k = 0.49 h/Mpc (right plot). The differences are slightly stronger for
larger values of k.
The value of ∆χ2
W|ν, testing the goodness of fit of WDM as "test" model against data
given by νDM considered to be the "true" model, are plotted with a gradient of colours in the
two dimensional plane of (λtrue
cut , λtest
cut ) in Fig. 12. Darker colours indicate the lower ∆χ2
W|ν,
while the dashed white diagonal line highlights where λtrue
cut = λtest
cut . We show the case where
ε = 0.2, however setting ε = 0 effectively only changes the scaling of the legend, such that
log10 ∆χ2(ε = 0) ≃1.24 × log10 ∆χ2(ε = 0.2). Note that ∆χ2
W|ν is shown as a function of
λtest
cut for three values of λtrue
cut in Fig. 7. As in the latter case, we find that the minimum value
of ∆χ2 for a fixed λtrue
cut corresponds to a value of λtest
cut slightly below λtrue
cut . This is particularly
visible λtrue
cut ≲1 × 10−3 Mpc/h. This implies that the assumption of the wrong model leads
to a small bias in the reconstruction of λcut.

contributions from MCGs while halos in the mass range 107 ≤M/M⊙≤1011 get contributions from
ACGs.

Fisher matrix analysis and results
C.1
Change of variables with Fisher matrices
Assuming that the Fisher matrix saturates the Cramer-Rao bound, we may estimate the sen-
sitivity of an observable to a given parameter by determining which value of that parameter
is equal to the associated inverse Fisher matrix element (for a 1σ detection threshold). In
this appendix we detail while this approach must be performed with extreme caution.
Consider a model defined by a set of parameters θ that can be mapped to another set of
parameters ρ by the bijective function g such that g(θ) = ρ and g−1(ρ) = θ. To this model
we can associate two Fisher matrices to the same observable. Let us call them Fθ and Fρ
respectively associated with θ and ρ. From the general expression of a Fisher matrix, our
two matrices are nonetheless related by the equation
Fθ = JT FρJ ,
or equivalently
F −1
ρ
= JF −1
θ JT ,
(C.1)
with J the Jacobian of the function g evaluated at the fiducial value. Consider now more
specifically the idealised scenario in which our astro/cosmo model is fully described by the
analytical transfer function derived in section 2. In that case, we can associate a DM mass
m to an interaction strength u. Let us denote h(m) the value of u that gives the exact same

then use the previous equations with g = (1, h), θ = (. . . , m), and ρ = (. . . , u), where the
dots would denote other model parameters than u and m that would be taken equal in θ and

(F −1

[h′(m⋆)]2 ,
(C.2)
where we denote the fiducial values u⋆and m⋆such that u⋆= h(m⋆). Consider now that the
fiducial model is such that
u⋆=
q
(F −1
ρ )uu
(C.3)
which, for the purpose of this appendix we will call at the detection limit of the νDM scenario.
The definition of detection threshold slightly differs in the main text as we account for the
fact that the posterior of u has to be truncated and is only defined on positive values, but
the exact same conclusion would hold. This simple requirement implies that
q
(F −1
θ )mm = h(m⋆)
|h′(m⋆)|
(C.4)
which is equal to m⋆if and only if h(m) = cmq with q = ±1 and c a constant. In other
word, unless the the relationship between u and m is linear or inverse there is no way that
q
(F −1
θ )mm = m⋆when u⋆=
q
(F −1
ρ )uu. In the specific case where f(m) = amb (which is
the case here, with b ≃−2.5) one has
q
(F −1
θ )mm = m⋆
|b| .
(C.5)
That is, for |b| > 1 it yields
q
(F −1
θ )mm < m⋆and when we detect u⋆we have already
detected the corresponding m⋆. Said differently, the sensitivity on m that we estimate with
the Fisher method is inherently stronger than that on u whatever we do. Notice that this
does not depend on the sign of b therefore, considering 1/m as a parameter instead of m
would not change anything. This result is associated to the fact that, even if one of the two
posterior distributions for u or m is Gaussian, then the other can only be Gaussian too if and
only if f(m) = am.
C.2
Computing the Fisher matrix: finding the plateaux
Evaluating the Fisher matrix elements requires the derivatives of the 21 cm power spectrum
over the parameters of the model. Numerically, for a parameter θ it can be obtained by the
evaluation of the power spectrum at two values θ± = θfiducial ± δθ around the fiducial. For
accuracy the step δθ must be large enough so that the difference of power spectra from θ+ and
θ−is not dominated by numerical noise, and small enough so that the two-points estimation
of the derivative makes sense. A good guess is usually to consider δθ to be a few percent
of the standard deviation σθ. For all astrophysical parameters we use the values obtained
in Ref. [117]. However, for an arbitrary cutoff scale, we do not know in advance the value
of the standard deviation and must rely on a shooting method. In practice we test a large
panel of values for δθ and try to identify a plateau where the value of σθ obtained becomes
independent of δθ, as it should be. However, this technique is often delicate to apply, due to
some residual numerical noise that makes the identification of a single plateau value arbitrary
to some level. In that regard, we have developed a fully automatised method in order to
overcome the arbitrariness and estimate the uncertainty in the identification of the plateau.

Let us assume that we have {σi
θ} for a range of steps {δi
θ} with i ∈[1, N]. We introduce
the 2D phase-space vectors yi = (σi

A plateau corresponds to a cluster of y values close to (µ, 0) with µ a constant. In order to
identify such a cluster we try to fit it with a Gaussian distribution of mean m = (µ, 0) and
covariance matrix C. Consider that the points in the cluster follow a distribution ∼P with
probability density function p. Then, we want to minimise the Kullback-Leibler divergence,
DKL(P || Q) =
Z
d2y p(y) ln
p(y)
pN(y |m, C) .
(C.7)
where pN is the probability density function associated to a bivariate normal distribution.
This minimisation problem is equivalent to the minimisation of the cost function
LN(µ, C) ≡−
Z
d2y p(y) ln [pN(y |m, C)] ∼−
X
y
ln [pN(y | m, C)] .
(C.8)
However, as such, the Gaussian distribution tries to accommodate for points that are far from
the plateau and therefore not in the cluster. A solution is, instead of a normal distribution,
to use an unnormalised truncated Gaussian distribution defined as
q(y |m, C, r, λ) =
(
pN(y | m, C)

p
(y −m)TC−1(y −m) ≤r

p
(y −m)TC−1(y −m) > r
(C.9)
with r a chosen value and λ a constant chosen such that λ ≫N exp(−r2)/
p
|det C|/(2π).
As a matter of fact, the value of λ is not important as long as it is satisfies the previous
condition. This choice is such that it will look for a cluster with an extension of r sigmas and
a distribution of point that is random elsewhere. In other words, the parameter r quantify the
compactness of the cluster making a plateau, and is the only arbitrary input of this method.
In the end, finding a plateau amounts to minimising
Lq(µ, C | r, λ) ≡−
X
y
ln [q(y | m, C, r, λ)] ,
(C.10)
for given values of r and λ. In this work we choose r = 2.58 (such that the Gaussian covers
99% of the cluster) and verify a posteriori the validity of our choice for λ. The minimisation
is performed using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm AdamW implemented in pyTorch.
Interestingly, this method automatically gives an estimated error on σθ. We choose to vary
λcut by 20 linearly distributed values of δλcut between 1% and 5%.

Triangle plots
Fig. 13 shows the marginalised one- and two-dimensional posteriors at 95% CL of the full set
of astrophysical parameters considered in the analysis. A selection of degeneracies relevant
for the λcut analysis are already discussed in Sec. 6.2. Also note that in the colder DM case
– 32 –


(purple), we recover similar degeneracies as the one obtained in the Fisher matrix forecasts of
Ref. [117], such as the anti-correlation betweens fesc and f⋆and between α⋆and αesc, as well as
similar 1D uncertainties. Some differences arise due to the fact that the astrophysics and noise
models are not exactly the same ([117] considered an older system temperature description).
For example, [117] uses one single X-ray amplitude which shows similar degeneracies as our
MCG amplitude LII
X but not necessarily with LIII
X .
