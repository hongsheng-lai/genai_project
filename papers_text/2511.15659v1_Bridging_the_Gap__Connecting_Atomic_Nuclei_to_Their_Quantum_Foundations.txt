We extend the QCD Parton Model analysis by employing a factorized nuclear structure model
that explicitly accounts for both individual nucleons and correlated nucleon pairs. This novel
framework establishes a paradigm that directly links the nuclear physics description of matter (in
terms of protons and neutrons) to the particle physics schema (in terms of quarks and gluons). Our
analysis of high-energy data from lepton Deep-Inelastic Scattering, Drell-Yan, and W/Z production
simultaneously extracts the universal effective distribution of quarks and gluons inside correlated
nucleon pairs, and their nucleus-specific fractions. The successful extraction of these universal
distributions marks a significant advance in our understanding of nuclear structure, as it directly
connects nucleon-level and parton-level quantities.

A Novel Paradigm:
Subatomic systems—including nucleons
and atomic nuclei, as well as dense astrophysi-
cal matter—derive their fundamental properties
from the complex, many-body interactions
among their constituent quarks and gluons, all
of which are precisely described by the theory
of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
We present a novel framework that com-
bines information from nuclear Parton Distri-
bution Functions (nPDFs) with Short-Range
Correlations (SRCs)1. This approach directly
establishes a crucial link between partonic
dynamics (quarks and gluons) and nuclear
dynamics (protons and neutrons).
The PDFs are a key component that allows
us to describe the complex internal structure
and interactions of nuclei. Notably, the nuclear
PDFs are not a simple sum of the PDFs for
free protons and neutrons [2, 3]. Instead, they
demonstrate significant nuclear modification
effects (such as the EMC effect, shadowing,
and antishadowing) that alter the momentum
distributions of quarks and gluons inside a
nucleus relative to those in individual nucleons.
nPDF Framework:
We adopt a model-agnostic approach by focusing on the broad-scale features common to
modern, high-resolution nuclear structure models, thereby minimizing dependence on specific
model details.
The parameterization framework for the nuclear Parton Distribution Functions
(nPDFs) differs significantly from those employed in conventional global analyses. Nevertheless, it
achieves a notably good description of the currently available nuclear data, as we shall demonstrate.
We construct our nPDF as a linear combination of a free-nucleon PDF (which accounts for the
quasi-free nucleons) and a universal Short-Range Correlation (SRC) PDF that describes the quark
and gluon distributions inside an SRC pair:

can be defined via a collinear factorization framework, and that the proton and neutron
distributions are related by isospin.2 Therefore, we apply the tools from perturbative QCD used for
free-nucleon PDFs to arrive at the physical predictions.
A crucial characteristic of SRCs is their universality across the full nuclear spectrum, meaning
the short-distance dynamics of the correlated pairs are largely independent of the specific nucleus.
We keep a model-independent approach as to the number of SRC pairs and their isospin
structure. The nuclear structure dependence is fully encapsulated in the fraction of nucleons in SRC
pairs, denoted by 𝐶𝐴
𝑝,𝑛[1, 8]. In fact, these nuclear structure parameters 𝐶𝐴
𝑝,𝑛will be independently
determined in our nPDF analysis for the first time (cf., Fig. 1), and tested for consistency with
independent results from specific nuclear structure studies.

Table 1: The partial 𝜒2/𝑁data values for the data subsets; the number
of data points (𝑁data) for each process are listed in the bottom row. The
traditional fit has 19 shape and 3 𝑊/𝑍normalization parameters.
The baseSRC and pnSRC fits have 21 shape, 3 𝑊/𝑍normalization, and
30 and 19 SRC parameters (𝐶𝐴
𝑝,𝑛), respectively. In total, there are 1684
data points after cuts. Note the last column (𝜒2
tot/𝑁DOF) fully takes into
account the number of fit parameters.
The analysis utilized the full
set of available data on nuclear
lepton DIS, Drell-Yan processes,
and 𝑊and 𝑍boson produc-
tion.
The corresponding theo-
retical predictions were obtained
at next-to-leading order (NLO)
in QCD. The DIS data primarily
constrain the 𝑢and 𝑑quark
and anti-quark distributions. In
contrast, the 𝑊and 𝑍boson pro-
duction data from LHC proton-
lead collisions also constrain strange quark and gluon distributions down to lower momentum
fractions of 𝑥∼10−3.
The energy-scale dependence is accounted for using the DGLAP evolution equation, which
also helps constrain the gluon distribution via the 𝑄-dependence of DIS data. The parton number
and momentum sum rules are guaranteed to be satisfied separately for the free-nucleon PDFs ( 𝑓𝑝
𝑖)
and for the SRC PDFs ( 𝑓SRC 𝑝
𝑖
). Because each component already satisfies these fundamental
rules, their linear combination (which forms the total nuclear PDF) must also satisfy the sum rules.
This holds independently of the specific values used for the proton and neutron SRC fractions
(𝐶𝐴
𝑝and 𝐶𝐴
𝑛).
The free-nucleon PDFs 𝑓𝑝
𝑖
are set to the nCTEQ15 proton distributions [2]. We have also
explored other proton sets from different groups and obtained comparable results.
The SRC
nucleon PDFs 𝑓SRC 𝑝
𝑖
use the same functional form as 𝑓𝑝
𝑖with 21 shape parameters. We perform
two independent analyses where i) 𝐶𝐴
𝑝and 𝐶𝐴
𝑛are allowed to vary freely, and ii) where we assume
proton-neutron SRC dominance, i.e. 𝐶𝐴
𝑝= 𝑁
𝑍×𝐶𝐴
𝑛≡𝐶𝐴. We refer to these fits as the baseSRC and
pnSRC fits, respectively. For comparison, we also repeated the traditional (mean-field-like) analysis
of Ref. [9] using the same dataset, which we refer to as the traditional fit.
2We will assume isospin symmetry to relate the proton and neutron nPDFs. Therefore, in the following discussion,
we will simply use 𝑓𝑝
𝑖and 𝑓SRC 𝑝
𝑖
to identify the free-nucleon and SRC nPDFs, respectively.

Analysis Results:
The 𝜒2 Results:
The resulting fit quality in terms of 𝜒2 are listed in Table 1 for each
data type separately, and for all data combined. The SRC fits result in overall 𝜒2
tot/𝑁DOF values
appreciably better than for the traditional fit; this fully takes into account the additional SRC
(𝐶𝐴
𝑝,𝑛) parameters.
nPDF Results:
The nPDFs obtained from the SRC approach (not shown) are generally
consistent with those from the traditional fits within the estimated uncertainties. The SRC
approach not only yields nPDFs that closely reproduce the traditional results (including the most
well-constrained valence distributions) but also achieves an improved 𝜒2/dof. This fit successfully
reproduces all data across the full range, corresponding to an 𝑥range of approximately 10−3 to 0.75.
Given that the initial nPDF parameterization in the SRC framework differs fundamentally
from the traditional functional form, achieving results comparable to those of the latter while
improving data description is a noteworthy achievement.
The 𝐶𝐴
𝑝,𝑛Coefficients:
Figure 1 shows the extracted 𝐶𝐴
𝑝and 𝐶𝐴
𝑛coefficients as determined by the global baseSRC.
The coefficients show logarithmic growth with the nuclear mass number 𝐴, starting from ∼5% for
He and reaching ∼25% for Pb.
Figure 1-a):
In the top panel of Fig. 1-a) we display {𝐶𝐴
𝑛, 𝐶𝐴
𝑝} for the baseSRC fit. We
also show a rescaled coefficient, (𝑁/𝑍)𝐶𝐴
𝑛, that accounts for the neutron excess when present. The
uncertainties of {𝐶𝐴
𝑛, 𝐶𝐴
𝑝} are obtained by evaluating the 𝜒2 while scanning across the parameters,
and reflect, in part, the number of data points available for each separate nucleus. The lines are
simple logarithmic fits to show the trend in 𝐴.
We first observe that the slopes of the proton fraction (𝐶𝐴
𝑝) and the neutron fraction (𝐶𝐴
𝑛)
of nucleons in SRC pairs are roughly similar when compared against the nuclear mass number
𝐴.
However, after accounting for the neutron excess (by multiplying 𝐶𝐴
𝑛by the factor 𝑁/𝑍),
we find that the slopes of 𝐶𝐴
𝑝and the rescaled (𝑁/𝑍)𝐶𝐴
𝑛become essentially the same within
the estimated uncertainties.
This result indicates that protons and neutrons participate in the
SRC interactions in approximately equal numbers, consistent with the hypothesis that SRCs are
dominated by proton–neutron pairs.
Furthermore, the observation that 𝐶𝐴
𝑝and the rescaled (𝑁/𝑍)𝐶𝐴
𝑛exhibit similar behavior
explains why imposing the constraint 𝐶𝐴
𝑝= (𝑁/𝑍)𝐶𝐴
𝑛in the pnSRC fit results in only a minimal
increase in 𝜒2/dof (from 0.80 to 0.82) relative to the baseSRC fit, where 𝐶𝐴
𝑝and 𝐶𝐴
𝑛are treated
independently.
We note that {𝐶𝐴
𝑛, 𝐶𝐴
𝑝} exhibit a scaling freedom on their absolute value due to a freedom in
the parameterization [8]. Although no evidence of this scaling freedom was identified in our results,
we focus the following discussion on the relative size of the coefficients instead of their absolute
values.
Example Nuclei:
For the baseSRC fit, the {𝐶𝐴
𝑝, 𝐶𝐴
𝑛} vary independently without constraints;
hence, the observed trends are purely due to the data. We previously noted that when the obtained
4

{𝐶𝐴
𝑝, 𝐶𝐴
𝑛} values are adjusted for the neutron excess present in heavy nuclei, the resulting effective
number of protons and neutrons in SRC pairs is approximately equal. We will now illustrate this
specific finding for the cases of gold and lead nuclei.
The estimated uncertainties for {𝐶𝐴
𝑝, 𝐶𝐴
𝑛} are displayed in Fig. 1 for the case of gold and lead are
roughly ±5%. For gold, 197
79 Au, we obtain𝐶𝐴
𝑝=0.256, 𝐶𝐴
𝑛=0.177. This implies 79×𝐶𝐴
𝑝≃20.2 protons
and 118×𝐶𝐴
𝑛≃20.9 neutrons are (effectively) modified by the SRC. Likewise for the case of lead,
208
82 Pb, we have 𝐶𝐴
𝑝=0.295, 𝐶𝐴
𝑛=0.202, which implies 82×𝐶𝐴
𝑝≃24.2 protons and 126×𝐶𝐴
𝑛≃25.5
neutrons are (effectively) modified.
This exemplifies the above observation that once the 𝐶𝐴-
coefficients are adjusted to account for the neutron excess, the effective number of protons and
neutrons within SRC pairs are approximately equal.
Proton-Neutron SRC Dominance:
More generally, we find the above pattern or proton-
neutron pairing is evident throughout the range of Fig. 1; we fit the {𝐶𝐴
𝑝, 𝐶𝐴
𝑛} values with a simple
2-parameter function, 𝑓(𝐴) = 𝑎log(𝐴) + 𝑏, to better display the trends. In the top panel of Fig. 1
we observe 𝐶𝐴
𝑝(blue line) and 𝐶𝐴
𝑛(gray line) are both increasing with 𝐴, but with differing slopes.
To account for the abundance of neutrons for non-isoscalar nuclei, we modify the original 𝐶𝐴
𝑛
values by a factor of 𝑁/𝑍, and this yields the orange line with a slope much closer to the 𝐶𝐴
𝑝slope
(blue line). By comparing the rescaled neutron fraction line, (𝑁/𝑍)𝐶𝐴
𝑛, with the original proton
fraction line, 𝐶𝐴
𝑝, we gain insight into two key aspects of the SRCs.
1. Proton-Neutron SRC Dominance: The overlap directly shows the extent to which the effective
number of protons and neutrons participating in SRC interactions are comparable, after
accounting for the nuclear neutron excess.
2. Nuclear 𝐴-Dependence:
The similarity in their slopes reveals the extent to which the
dependence of these parameters on the nuclear mass number (𝐴) is comparable, highlighting
their universality.
These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the SRC pairs are dominantly proton-
neutron combinations.
Figure 1-b):
Focusing on the lower panel, Figure 1-b) we display the 𝐶𝐴
𝑝coefficients for
the baseSRC. We also show the logarithmic fits for both baseSRC and pnSRC and they closely
coincide. Additionally, we overlay predictions from independent, extractions from both nuclear
structure calculations [7] and quasi-elastic electron scattering measurements [4–6].
This behavior is consistent with the observed 𝑝𝑛-dominance previously established in nuclear
structure studies [10, 11].
Consequently, the agreement between the baseSRC and pnSRC fits
provides an initial indication of consistency between quark–gluon–level analyses and traditional
nuclear structure observations.
Conclusion:
We have presented a novel paradigm that directly links nuclear structure information to parton
(quark and gluon) dynamics. This framework enables the first direct extraction of nPDFs that is
fully consistent with independent nuclear structure determinations.
This analysis yields a data description that is similar to or better than that of the traditional
parameterization and enables a meaningful physical interpretation of the fit in terms of the nuclear

dynamics. The study successfully determines both the standard “average” nPDFs (which can be
directly compared with traditional nPDF fits), and the universal distribution of partons in SRC
nucleon pairs, along with the fractions of such SRC pairs.
The agreement between the SRC fractions derived here and those obtained from low-energy
quasielastic measurements establishes a clear connection between high-energy partonic behavior
and low-energy nuclear structure, marking a significant step toward understanding nuclei in terms
of partonic QCD processes.
The SRC framework provides additional flexibility by allowing one to (i) follow the traditional
approach using averaged nucleon distributions, or (ii) construct a more detailed initial-state descrip-
tion in which each nucleon is represented by either a free-nucleon PDF or an SRC-modified PDF,
depending on its correlation state.
Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the SRC parameterization (in which the dependence of 𝐴
and 𝑥is factorized) produces an excellent description of the data. The conceptual simplicity of this
successful parameterization is striking.
