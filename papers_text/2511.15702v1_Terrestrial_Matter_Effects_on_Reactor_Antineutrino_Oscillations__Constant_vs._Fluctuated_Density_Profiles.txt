Abstract
The JUNO Collaboration has recently released its first reactor antineutrino oscillation re-
sult, achieving unprecedented precision in the measurement of ∆m2
21 and sin2 θ12. We emphasize
that the accurate determination and modeling of the terrestrial matter density profile are funda-
mental for extracting the oscillation parameters and probing the neutrino mass ordering. This
paper presents a realistic piecewise-constant model for the shallow crustal density profile along
the baselines from Taishan and Yangjiang to the experimental hall, based on geological and
petrophysical information. The uncertainty in the density profiles arises from variations in the
density and length of each segment, both of which are conservatively estimated to be 10%. A
careful comparison of constant and fluctuated density profiles is provided and the implications
for the precision measurement of oscillation parameters are discussed. Finally, we also discuss
the possibility of tomography of the shallow Earth’s crust in future reactor neutrino experiments.

Introduction
The discovery of the neutrino oscillation phenomena [1, 2], which demonstrated that neutrinos have
masses and that lepton flavors are mixed, marks a significant milestone in particle physics. Over
the past two decades, numerous solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator neutrino experiments
have collected a substantial number of neutrino events [3] and established a coherent picture of the
three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework [4–6], which is described by the 3 × 3 Pontecorvo–Maki–
Nakagawa–Sakata (PMNS) [7–9] matrix:

(1.2)
where (i, j = 1, 2, 3, i > j) and mi is the mass of the i-th mass eigenstate νi.
The three-flavor oscillation framework has been successfully measured and tested to within a few
percent [4–6]. However, several key scientific questions remain unanswered. Most notably, the ordering
of the neutrino mass spectrum—normal mass ordering (NMO: m1 < m2 < m3) versus inverted mass
ordering (IMO: m3 < m1 < m2)—is still unknown, as is the value of the Dirac CP-violating phase δ.
In addition, the absolute neutrino mass scale and the nature of neutrino masses—specifically, whether
neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles—remain unknown. They can be probed by β decay and
neutrinoless double-β-decay experiments, as well as cosmological observations [10–13].
The global neutrino program in the coming decades is organized around these promising frontiers.
Next-generation long-baseline accelerator experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande [14] and DUNE [15]
aim to precisely measure the atmospheric oscillation parameters and the CP-violating phase δ. On the
reactor side, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) [16,17] is a next-generation
oscillation experiments aiming at the determination of neutrino mass ordering [18,19] and measuring
oscillation parameters with sub-percent precision [20]. All of these next-generation neutrino oscil-
lation experiments will operate in an era of high precision and require better control of systematic
uncertainties on both the theoretical and experimental sides.
The JUNO experiment, the first of these next-generation flagship experiments to begin operations,
has published its initial reactor antineutrino oscillation results [21,22]. It achieved unprecedented pre-
cision in measuring ∆m2
21 and sin2 θ12, with uncertainties of 1.55% and 2.81%, respectively. With this
accuracy level, the corrections due to terrestrial matter effects [23,24] on ∆m2
21 and sin2 θ12 will be at
the percent level [25,26], and cannot be neglected in the analysis. In the previous analyses, a constant
density profile, characterized by an average crustal density, was assumed and deemed reasonably ac-
curate. However, since the majority of the neutrino propagation trajectories are relatively shallow,
2


the density variation may be significant depending on the local geological conditions. Therefore, it
is important to evaluate the effect of a variable density profile on the survival probability and its
potential impact on the oscillation parameters.
In this work, we focus on the impact of realistic crustal density variations along the JUNO baselines.
By utilizing geological maps and petrophysical data from South China, we construct a piecewise-
constant matter density model for the density profiles extending from the Taishan and Yangjiang
nuclear power plants to the experimental hall. We evaluate the uncertainties in the density profiles by
incorporating detailed local information regarding crustal density and geometric baseline variations
in each segment. Using an efficient semi-analytical method based on the Cayley-Hamilton theorem,
we compare the differences in neutrino survival probabilities between the variable density profile
and its constant density approximation, and discuss the potential impact on future measurements of
oscillation parameters. Finally, we explore the possibility of shallow Earth crust tomography in future
reactor neutrino experiments.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2, we construct the density profile model
along the Taishan–JUNO and Yangjiang–JUNO baselines using geological information. In Sec. 3, we
provide a brief recap of three-flavor neutrino oscillations in matter and introduce the semi-analytical
formalism used to analyze piecewise-constant density profiles. Sec. 4 presents our numerical results for
the survival probabilities and illustrates the impacts of different choices of density profiles. In Sec. 5,
we further investigate the impact of possible anomalous density perturbations, such as localized water-
or air-like structures along the baselines, and discuss their implications for shallow crust tomography
with reactor antineutrinos. Finally, our conclusions and a brief outlook are provided in Sec. 6.

Matter density profile along the baselines
2.1
Geological model and baseline discretizations
The JUNO detector is located about 650 m underground, whereas the reactors are slightly above sea
level. Reactor antineutrinos thus propagate predominantly through the upper crust, over relatively
shallow depths. In this regime, lateral variations of the density are dominated by changes in outcrop-
ping strata and lithology rather than by large-scale crust–mantle structures. Under these conditions,
it is reasonable to approximate each surface geological unit by a representative bulk density; residual
small-scale variations are expected at the level of a few percent. In the following sections we adopt
segment-wise fluctuations up to ±10% as a deliberately conservative bound that comfortably covers
these geophysical uncertainties.
We briefly summarize the construction of our density profile model. Figure 1 shows the topo-
graphic and geological maps of the JUNO detector site at Jiangmen and the two reactor complexes,
Taishan (TS) and Yangjiang (YJ). The topographic map illustrates the surface elevation along the
two baselines, while the geological map displays the distribution of surface rock units in South China.
The white lines indicate the straight baselines from the reactor cores to JUNO, which traverse a

variety of surface geological units. The density structure along each baseline is inferred from these
mapped geological units together with the petrophysical properties of the corresponding strata and
rock types [27].
To model the matter density along these baselines, we extract the strata and lithology units
intersected by the straight line connecting each reactor complex to the JUNO detector from the
geological map. Wherever the baseline crosses a boundary between two mapped surface geological
units, we define a new segment. In this way, the path from Taishan to JUNO is divided into 12 rock
segments, and the path from Yangjiang to JUNO into 14 rock segments. The length of each segment
is determined by the distance between consecutive intersections with geological boundaries.
It is worth noting that the actual oscillation baselines are slightly tilted with respect to the local
ground surface, since the reactor cores are located about 2 m above ground level, while the JUNO
detector is situated at a depth of about 750 m underground. Along the straight line connecting a
reactor core to the JUNO detector, the antineutrinos therefore first propagate over a short distance
in air before entering the shallow crust. In our piecewise-constant description we account for this by
adding an initial segment with density ρ = 0 in front of the rock segments listed in Tables 1 and
2. As a result, although the geological sampling along the TS–JUNO (YJ–JUNO) baseline yields 12
(14) rock segments, the effective profiles used in the oscillation calculations consist of NTS = 13 and
NYJ = 15 segments in total, including the initial air segment. This segmented representation of the
baselines will be used in the following both for the discussion of matter effects and for comparison
with previous studies based on a constant-density approximation.
Previous studies have conducted extensive tests and summarized the density characteristics of
typical strata and rocks in South China, as compiled in Ref. [27]. The densities assigned to each
segment are based on typical rock densities for the corresponding lithology along the JUNO baselines.
The resulting segment lengths, densities and rock types for TS–JUNO and YJ–JUNO are summarized
4


in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The surface elevation and the associated surface density along each
baseline are plotted in Figs. 2 and 3. These figures illustrate that the density variations are relatively
modest, typically at the level of a few percent around a mean crustal density of ∼2.5 g/cm3.
2.2
Fluctuations of the matter density profile
In the following we discuss how to model realistic fluctuations of the matter density profile along
the Taishan–JUNO and Yangjiang–JUNO baselines, and clarify their impact on the effective average
density that enters the neutrino oscillation probabilities.
For definiteness, we denote the reference piecewise-constant profile obtained from the geological
information in Sec. 2.1 by {ρ(0)
i , L(0)
i }, where ρ(0)
i
and L(0)
i
are the density and length of the i-th
segment, and P
i L(0)
i
= L is the total baseline length. As discussed in Sec. 2.1, the Taishan–JUNO
baseline is divided into NTS = 13 segments and the Yangjiang–JUNO baseline into NYJ = 15 segments.
The first segment in both cases corresponds to propagation in air, and thus its matter density is set
to zero and not allowed to fluctuate.

In the numerical calculations of Sec. 4, this piecewise-constant profile is used as the reference
density model. To account for possible uncertainties in the geological interpretation and for local
heterogeneities that are not resolved by the surface map, we adopt conservative fluctuation ranges
in both density and segment length.
Specifically, we allow the density in each segment to vary
independently within ±10% of its reference value, and the effective lengths of the segments to fluctuate
within ±10% while keeping the total baseline length fixed, as detailed below.

so that the relative deviation from the reference value, ∆ρAverage

given by a weighted average of the segment fluctuations δρi. In the numerical scan in Sec. 4 we find
that for |δρi| ≤10% the typical (one-standard-deviation) fluctuation of ρAverage is of order 1.5% for
both baselines, and 95% of the random realizations lie within about ±3% around the reference value.
Thus, even if each segment is allowed to vary independently within ±10%, the baseline-averaged
density remains remarkably stable at the percent level.
It is also instructive to consider the opposite limiting case in which the density fluctuations of all
segments are fully correlated. In this case we may write
δρi ≡δ ,
|δ| ≤10% ,
(2.6)
so that all segment densities are rescaled by the same factor, ρi = ρ(0)
i (1 + δ). The corresponding
average density is then given by

(2.7)
and the relative deviation of the average density is simply

= δ .
(2.8)
If the common fluctuation δ is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the interval [−0.1, 0.1], the
associated one-standard-deviation fluctuation is σδ = 0.1/
√
3 ≃5.8%, and the full allowed range of
ρAverage extends up to ±10% around the reference value. This fully correlated scenario corresponds to
a global mis-normalization of the crustal density scale, rather than to local heterogeneities between
different segments. In the following we treat it as a conservative upper bound on possible shifts of
the effective average density; its impact on the oscillation probabilities is effectively illustrated by the
constant-density variations considered in Sec. 4.
(ii) Fluctuations of segment lengths. The uncertainties of the segment boundaries correspond
to uncertainties in the segment lengths. A physically motivated way to describe them is to regard
the internal interfaces along the baseline as being known only up to a finite longitudinal resolution.
Denoting the original positions of the interfaces by x(0)
k
(k = 1, . . . , N + 1), with x(0)

N+1 = L
and L(0)

small interval around its reference position,

(2.9)
where we take α = 0.1 as a conservative estimate. The new segment lengths are then given by
Li = xi+1 −xi = L(0)
i
+ δLi ,
δLi ≡∆xi+1 −∆xi .
(2.10)
8


By construction the baseline length remains exactly fixed, P
i Li = xN+1 −x1 = L, and neighbouring
segments are anti-correlated: if an interface moves to the right, the segment on its left becomes shorter
and that on its right becomes longer. We stress that this picture corresponds closely to the physical
origin of the geometric uncertainty, namely the limited knowledge of where exactly the geological
interfaces intersect the oscillation baseline.
In this case we keep the segment densities fixed at their reference values, ρi = ρ(0)
i , and the average
density becomes

δLi .
(2.11)
Equation (2.11) makes it clear why the impact of the segment-length fluctuations on ρAverage is much
smaller than that of the density fluctuations in Eq. (2.5). Only the deviations of each segment density
from the already narrow band around ρAverage enter, and the contributions from the different segments
tend to cancel because the δLi are constrained by P
i δLi = 0 and are strongly anti-correlated through
Eq. (2.10). Numerically we find that for |δLi|/L(0)
i
≲10% the typical fluctuation of ρAverage induced
by the length variations alone is only of order 10−3, i.e. at the level of a few 0.01%, for both baselines.
Therefore the geometrical uncertainty of the segment lengths has a negligible impact on the effective
average matter density.‖
(iii) Combined fluctuations of densities and lengths. Finally, in order to mimic a conservative
and yet realistic matter profile uncertainty, we allow both the segment densities and the segment
lengths to fluctuate simultaneously according to Eqs. (2.4), (2.9) and (2.10). To leading order in the
small quantities δρi and δLi, the deviation of the average density can be written as
ρAverage
ρ+L
≃ρAverage
ρ
+
 ρAverage
L
−ρAverage
,
(2.12)
so that the variances of the two contributions approximately add. Since the length-induced part is
suppressed by the small spread of the segment densities around ρAverage and by cancellations between
neighbouring segments, its variance is much smaller than that induced by the density fluctuations.
Therefore the distribution of ρAverage
ρ+L
is practically indistinguishable from that obtained in the density-
only case in Eq. (2.5). In particular, the typical size of the fluctuation of the average density for
|δρi| ≤10% remains at the level of O(1%), while the additional uncertainty from the segment-length
fluctuations stays at the O(10−3) level.
As a consequence, in the discussion of matter effects on
the reactor antineutrino oscillation probabilities in Sec. 4 we will focus on the impact of the density
fluctuations, and treat the uncertainty due to the geometric segmentation as a subdominant effect.
‖As a cross-check we have also considered a simpler scheme in which each segment length is independently rescaled
according to Li →L(0)
i (1 + δLi) with |δLi| ≤10%, followed by a global rescaling of all Li such that the total baseline
length L is restored. This alternative model slightly overestimates the effect of length fluctuations, but still yields
fluctuations of ρAverage at the level of ∼0.05%, fully consistent with the more realistic interface-displacement model
described by Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10).

Neutrino oscillations in matter
In this section, we recap the fundamental formulas for three-flavor neutrino oscillations in matter
and introduce an efficient semi-analytical method for exact calculations.
In vacuum, the neutrino oscillations are governed by a Schr¨odinger-like evolution equation in the
flavor basis,
i d
dxνα(x) = Hvac να(x) ,
(3.1)
where να = (νe, νµ, ντ)T denotes the flavor eigenstate vector and x the distance neutrinos have trav-
elled. The vacuum Hamiltonian reads

where Eν is the neutrino energy.
For reactor antineutrino experiments, we are interested in the survival probability of electron
antineutrinos, P(¯νe →¯νe), which can be written in a compact form as [20,28]:

When neutrinos propagate in matter, coherent forward scattering on electrons induces an effective

Approximate analytic expressions for P C
ee in the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, valid
for reactor experiments, can be found in Ref. [25], where the leading matter corrections were shown to
be relevant for precision measurements of ∆m2
21 and sin2 θ12 and mass ordering. The exact three-flavor
oscillation probabilities in constant-density matter for arbitrary flavor transitions can be written in
fully analytical form, see for example Refs. [29–37], while a variety of compact approximate formulas
tailored to different experimental regimes are available in Refs. [25,38–45].
In a realistic and accurate manner, the crust consists of different geological units with different
densities, and the baselines from each reactor complex to the detector cross multiple rock formations.
To take this into account, we consider a position-dependent matter density profile ρ(x) obtained
from local geological surveys and geophysical data. For practical calculations, it is convenient to
approximate ρ(x) by a set of N segments with piecewise constant densities,
ρ(x) ≃ρi ,
xi−1 < x < xi ,
i = 1, . . . , N ,
(3.6)
with segment lengths Li = xi −xi−1 satisfying PN
i=1 Li = L.
In each segment the Hamiltonian Hi is constant, so the evolution operator in the corresponding
segment is
Si = exp[−i Hi Li] = exp [−iMiLi/(2Eν)] ,
(3.7)
where Mi is the effective mass-squared matrix in matter. According to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem,
the matrix exponential Si for a 3×3 matrix can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial in Mi [34,46,47],
Si = s0I + s1Mi + s2M 2
i ,
(3.8)
where I is the 3 × 3 identity matrix, and the coefficients sk (k = 0, 1, 2) are determined by the
eigenvalues λk of Mi (or equivalently of M ′
i = U †MiU). Explicitly one has

The full evolution operator for a baseline L is obtained by multiplying the segment operators in

Note that an arbitrary matter-density profile ρ(x) can be approximated with controllable accuracy by
choosing a sufficiently large number of segments N, so that this semi-analytical treatment allows one
to achieve the desired precision for realistic, position-dependent density profiles. This semi-analytical
approach, in which the realistic crustal profile is represented by a finite number of constant-density
segments, provides an accurate and efficient way to calculate the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos
in a non-uniform medium. Note that this framework has been written for antineutrinos, and the
corresponding expressions for neutrinos can be obtained by changing U →U ∗and A →−A in the
effective Hamiltonian of Eq. (3.4).

Numerical results
In this section we present our numerical results for the matter effects on the ¯νe →¯νe survival proba-
bility along the TS–JUNO and YJ–JUNO baselines. We first quantify the impact of variable matter
density on the oscillation probability, and then discuss its implications for the precision measurement
of oscillation parameters and for the determination of the neutrino mass ordering.
To start, we shall employ the current global best-fit values of the three-flavor oscillation parameters,
based on the NuFIT 6.0 (2024) analysis [5]. For the JUNO baselines, we consider the locations of
the JUNO site as well as the YJ and TS nuclear power plants [16]. The TS–JUNO and YJ–JUNO
baselines are determined based on the average positions of the individual reactor cores.
For the
Taishan complex, we use LTS = 52.695 km, which represents the average distance from the first and
second cores to JUNO. For the Yangjiang complex, we adopt LYJ = 52.465 km, corresponding to the
average distance from the third and fourth cores to JUNO.
The matter density along each baseline is described by the segmented piecewise-constant profiles
constructed in Sec. 2, specifically utilizing the sets {ρ(0)
i , L(0)
i } introduced in Sec. 2.1 and Sec. 2.2,
including the initial air segment where ρ = 0. The corresponding baseline-averaged densities are
defined in Eq. (2.11). Using the segment information presented in Tables 1 and 2, we find
ρAverage
TS
≃2.541 g/cm3 ,
(4.14)
12


and
ρAverage
YJ
≃2.554 g/cm3 ,
(4.15)
which will serve as benchmark constant densities for the subsequent analysis. We also specified con-
servative fluctuation ranges of ±10% for both the segment densities and segment lengths as discussed
in Sec. 2.2.
First, we examine the absolute magnitude of variable matter effects on the ¯νe →¯νe survival
probability. As shown in Fig. 4, the absolute differences between vacuum survival probability P Vac
ee
and variable-matter survival probability P Vari
ee
are presented for the reference matter density profiles
along the TS–JUNO and YJ–JUNO baselines. One can observe that they are at the percent level
and will be comparable to the expected uncertainties of ∆m2
21 and sin2 θ12. This conclusion is rather
consistent with Ref. [25] using the constant density approximation.

Next we will discuss the effects of variable density profiles. Considering the potential correlations
in the density fluctuations of connected or nearby segments, we analyze two extreme scenarios:
• Scenario A: profiles in which the densities of all rock segments are coherently rescaled within a
permitted ±10%, corresponding to global upward or downward shifts of the baseline-averaged
density;
• Scenario B: profiles in which the densities of all rock segments are randomly rescaled within the
allowed ±10% band, thus fine structures of the density variations are allowed.
All these sampled representative profiles satisfy |δρi| ≤10% and |δLi|/L(0)
i
≤10% for every segment,
and their baseline-averaged densities lie within the ∼1–3% band around the reference values quantified
in Sec. 2.2.
Using the benchmark constant density profiles in Eqs. (4.14) and Eq. (4.15), we compare the effects
of variable matter against the corresponding constant approximation in Fig. 5 for both the TS-JUNO
13


and YJ-JUNO baselines. In each panel, the black and gray curves represent Scenario A, where the
constant reference density is coherently increased or decreased within a 10% range, respectively. These
curves serve as a simple benchmark for the effect of fully correlated uncertainty in the reference crustal
density profile, which is on the order of 10−3, in contrast to the total contributions at the percent level.
In contrast, the colored curves illustrate five representative realizations of fluctuations in Scenario B,
generated by allowing the density in each rock segment along the baseline to vary independently within
the 10% range. It is important to note that the differences in survival probability are significantly
smaller in Scenario B than in Scenario A due to the effects of statistical averaging.

Figure 5: Variable matter effects on the ¯νe →¯νe survival probability along the TS–JUNO (upper
panel) and YJ–JUNO (lower panel) baselines for NMO (left panel) and IMO (right panel).
Now we discuss how the variable matter effects affects the measurement of oscillation parameters
and mass ordering. From the first reactor antineutrino oscillation result of JUNO [21], the precision of
∆m2
21 and sin2 θ12 reached 1.55% and 2.81% respectively. Meanwhile, it will reach to 0.3% and 0.5%
in 6 yrs and even smaller for the entire lifetime of 20 yrs.
In Fig. 6, the comparison of the survival probability differences between the oscillation parameter
variation and the density profile variation is illustrated. As an illustration, Fig. 6 shows the absolute
differences in the survival probability,
P X
ee −P BF
ee
 for the TS–JUNO baseline and NMO, where P BF
ee
14


is the probability calculated with the best-fit values, and P X
ee with one of the parameters shifted
according to the expected JUNO precision. For clarity, in each panel only one parameter is varied at
a time, while the others are fixed at their best-fit values. The black and grey lines are that of variable
density profile with the uncertainty of Scenario A. From the figures, one can read that the uncertainty
of matter density profiles is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the current precision of
oscillation parameters, but will increase to 20% or 50% for longer running time. Therefore a careful
investigation and modelling of the density profiles is needed in the future.
We now turn to the impact of variable matter density profiles on mass ordering determination. In
the upper panels of Fig. 7, we illustrate the differences in survival probabilities between NMO and
IMO as follows:
P C,MO
ee
(Eν) =
P C,NMO
ee
(Eν) −P C,IMO
ee
(Eν)
 ,
(4.16)
for the constant density profiles. Similarly, we can define the differences in survival probabilities for
variable density profiles as:
P Vari,MO
ee
(Eν) =
P Vari,NMO
ee
(Eν) −P Vari,IMO
ee
(Eν)
 ,
(4.17)
and illustrate the absolute differences of these quantities in the lower panels of Fig. 7. Note that the
black and gray curves represent Scenario A, while the colored curves correspond to Scenario B. By
comparing the magnitudes of these differences, we conclude that variations in matter density profiles
contribute only 1% to the mass ordering sensitivity, making them relatively negligible. Therefore,
we can assert that the additional uncertainty introduced by the imperfect knowledge of the matter
density profile is insignificant, and the determination of mass ordering remains robust against realistic
variable matter density effects.

Impact of anomalous density perturbations
In previous discussions, we have assumed that the matter density along the TS-JUNO and YJ-JUNO
baselines can be described by a piecewise-constant profile with moderate segmented fluctuations,
typically on the order of ±10% around the reference rock densities. This approach is well justified by
the geological information available along the JUNO baselines.
In this section, however, we will explore the possibility of shallow crust tomography using reactor
antineutrinos, considering the potential existence of localized structures that may deviate more signifi-
cantly from the average crustal rock. These structures could include water-filled regions, underground
reservoirs, or localized low-density cavities within fractured rocks.
For definiteness, let us consider a single localized anomaly with length ∆La and density ρa em-
bedded in an otherwise standard rock profile characterized by an average density ¯ρ0. If the baseline
length is L, the new baseline-averaged density becomes

This straightforward expression indicates that, even if ρa differs significantly from the typical rock
density, its impact on the baseline-averaged density is suppressed by the ratio ∆La/L. To quantify
this effect, we take ¯ρ0 ≃2.6 g/cm3 as a representative crustal density and L ≃53 km as a typical
baseline. A water-like anomaly corresponds roughly to ρa ≃1.0 g/cm3, while an air-filled cavity has
ρa ≃0 on the scale relevant for matter effects. For a 1 km-long water anomaly one finds

and for an air cavity of the same length,
δ¯ρ
¯ρ0
≃(0 −1) 1 km
53 km ≈−1.9% .
(5.21)
Shorter or more localized structures (e.g., ∆La ≲0.5 km) lead to relative shifts of ≲1%, while more
extended anomalous regions are disfavored by the available geological information along the baselines.
The matter potential in the flavor basis is proportional to the electron number density,
A = 2
√
2 GFNeEν ∝ρ ,
(5.22)
so that the fractional change of the effective potential is δA/A ≃δ¯ρ/¯ρ0. At the JUNO or future reactor
antineutrino experiments, the standard matter effect induces only a percent-level modification of the
¯νe survival probability with respect to vacuum oscillations. Therefore, an additional O(1%) change
in the average density from a localized water-like or air-like anomaly leads to a further suppression of
the matter effect by a few ×10−4 in the survival probability.
To make this conclusion more explicit, Fig. 8 illustrates, for the TS–JUNO baseline and NMO, the
absolute difference of |P Anomaly
ee
−P C
ee| obtained in a constant-density profile and in profiles containing
a localized air-like segment. The constant reference probability P C
ee is computed assuming a uniform
density ρAverage
TS
, and in the anomalous cases we keep the same uniform density ρAverage
TS
along the whole
baseline, except for an additional 1 km air layer (with ρ ≃0) inserted either at the beginning of the
baseline (red curve, between 0 and 1 km), in the middle (blue curve, around L/2), or close to the
detector (green curve, near the end of the baseline). Over the full neutrino energy window (Eν ≃2–
12 MeV), the induced differences remain at the level of a few ×10−4, in excellent agreement with the
analytical estimate based on Eqs. (5.19)–(5.21). We have also verified that analogous configurations
for the YJ–JUNO baseline and for IMO lead to very similar corrections. In addition replacing the
anomalous air layer by a water-like segment with ρa ≃1.0 g/cm3 yields very similar results.
More generally, we have explicitly examined several extreme configurations in which a rock segment
in the baseline model is replaced by either water or air, with ∆La extending up to the kilometer
scale and located at various positions along the baseline. In all these cases, the resulting changes
in P(¯νe →¯νe) were found to be much smaller than the effects of the typical ±10% segment-wise
fluctuations discussed in Sec. 4. Therefore, we conclude that potential anomalous density structures,
such as localized water-filled regions or air cavities, do not undermine the robustness of our conclusions
regarding matter effects on reactor antineutrino oscillations at JUNO. As a result, an even larger
detector is necessary for effective shallow crust tomography using reactor antineutrinos.

Within the standard three-flavor oscillation framework, we computed the ¯νe →¯νe survival proba-
bilities for both constant-density and variable-density profiles, and quantified the resulting differences
for both normal and inverted mass orderings. We further assessed the implications of these differ-
ences on the precision measurement of the oscillation parameters ∆m2
21 and sin2 θ12 and neutrino mass
ordering.
Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows:
• The absolute difference |P C
ee −P Vari
ee
| induced by realistic density variations is approximately
10−3 for the correlated density fluctuations of Scenario A, accounting for about 10% of the total
19


matter effects. While this effect is negligible at the current precision, it should be considered
and addressed for future measurements aiming at millesimal precision.
• The mass-ordering discriminant P C,MO
ee
= |P C,NMO
ee
−P C,IMO
ee
| is typically on the order of 10−3–
10−2, whereas the correction |P Vari,MO
ee
−P C,MO
ee
| resulting from variable matter density is at
most on the order of 10−4. Consequently, realistic density variations may statistically alter the
ordering discriminant by at most a few percent, which is negligible. Thus, the mass-ordering
determination at JUNO is largely insensitive to the detailed structure of the crustal density
along the baselines.
From a broader perspective, the commencement of JUNO’s data collection and the release of the
first reactor antineutrino oscillation results signify an important advancement in the global neutrino
program. Alongside Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE, JUNO will contribute to completing the under-
standing of three-flavor oscillations by determining the mass ordering and significantly enhancing the
precision of the mixing angles and mass-squared differences. With the advent of the era of precision
measurements in neutrino physics, the contributions of sub-leading and subtle effects may need to be
reconsidered, such as the variable matter density profile considered in this work. Other such efforts
include studies of indirect unitarity violation effects [48], radiative corrections to neutrino propagation
in matter and to elastic neutrino-electron scattering [49–51]. Systematically incorporating these effects
will further increase the reliability of oscillation experiments, enhance their discovery potential [52],
and support precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and searches for related new
physics.
