Abstract. We establish exact scalings for the maximal group velocity of translation-invariant
quantum walks in periodic electric fields.
Our main result shows that the maximal group
velocity decays exponentially with the period of the field in the whole parameter range, thus
affirming a conjecture of [3] and at the same time augmenting it to an exact equality. We further
demonstrate explicit revival relations and characterize the absolutely continuous spectrum in
these models. Our results apply directly also to generalized CMV matrices.
1. Introduction
Periodic quantum systems are commonly associated with ballistic transport, where states
propagate linearly in time [10,33]. An intriguing and fundamental question arises naturally: is
it possible to manipulate the velocity by suitably tuning the system’s (periodic) parameters?
Addressing this question is the primary theme and driving motivation of the present work.
The physical setup in which we study this question are so-called quantum walks, which have
emerged as powerful models for studying quantum dynamics. Originally introduced as quantum
analogues of classical random walks, quantum walks capture essential aspects of quantum co-
herence and interference. In folklore wisdom, this makes them propagate ballistically compared
to the diffusive spread of their classical counterparts [43,51]. They have since found numerous
applications as subroutines in quantum algorithms [45,46], as quantum simulators [11,31], and
in the study of topological phenomena [8,9,23,44] where new invariants arise due to the discrete
nature of time.
From a mathematical perspective, quantum walks offer a rich environment for rigorous spec-
tral and dynamical analysis, connecting features of discrete quantum systems to harmonic anal-
ysis [12,22,27,37], operator theory [23,25,27,36], and localization phenomena [5,30,38–42,47].
Particularly noteworthy is the connection between so-called split-step quantum walks and CMV
matrices [13, 15], which are five-diagonal unitary matrices that play a fundamental role in the
theory of orthogonal polynomials and can be thought of as a unitary counterpoint of Jacobi
matrices [17,49,50].
Quantum walks subject to external fields have been extensively studied [3, 14, 19, 21, 24, 53].
In the simplest case, electric fields in one spatial dimension, the dynamics are highly sensitive to
the field’s arithmetic nature [29,30]: For rational electric fields, the system is effectively periodic,
which results in ballistic transport at large time scales. Surprisingly, on timescales of the order
of the denominator of the field, “revivals” occur: the initial state is reproduced with an accuracy
that is exponentially good in the period of the system. On the other hand, irrational electric fields
produce complex dynamics that depend on their arithmetic properties: well-approximable fields
produce hierarchical dynamics while generic fields lead to Anderson localization characterized
by pure point spectrum and exponentially localized eigenfunctions [30].
In this paper, we establish an exact scaling for the maximum group velocity of quantum
walks in rational electric fields which can be thought of a single-particle equivalent of the Lieb-
Robinson velocity [28, 48]. We prove that this maximal (group) velocity of split-step walks in

rational electric fields decays exponentially in the period m of the field. More precisely, we show
that the maximal velocity is exactly |a|m, where a with |a| < 1 is the transmission coefficient
characterizing the walk. This bound extends the previous results from [3] significantly, where the
proof techniques limited the validity to an upper bound for transmission coefficients |a| < 1/4
only.
We use a conjunction of the Fourier techniques from [29] and a generalized “sieving”
technique which states that the product of any two shift-coin walks amounts to a direct sum of
split-step walks.
Our results complement recent works on discrete Schr¨odinger operators with periodic po-
tentials [1, 2]. The velocity bounds established there demonstrate that the maximal velocity,
while positive, can be made arbitrarily small by controlling the potential. Our findings similarly
highlight that careful periodic modulation can systematically control and suppress transport ve-
locities, offering significant insights into engineering quantum systems with tailored dynamical
properties.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces quantum walks in the presence of
electric fields and presents our main results on maximal velocity, revival relations, and spectral
properties (Theorem 2.1). These results are proved in Section 3 using a Fourier transform and
the sieving method developed in Theorem 3.3. Section 3.4 collects crucial intermediate results
on velocity bounds for powers and direct sums of walks, that are used in the proof of Theorem
2.1. Finally, the conjecture in [3] that we prove is written in the setting of CMV matrices. To
make explicit the connection between our results and those of [3], we discuss the connection
between quantum walks and generalized extended CMV matrices in the Appendix.
2. Model and results
2.1. Quantum walks
We consider quantum walks on the one-dimensional lattice with a two-dimensional internal
degree of freedom. These systems are modeled as unitary operators on H = ℓ2(Z) ⊗C2, where
the two factors represent the position space and the two internal degrees of freedom of the
quantum particle, respectively. We label the basis of H as δs
n = δn ⊗es for n ∈Z and s ∈{+, −}
with the ordering
. . . , δ−
n−1, δ+
n , δ−
n , δ+
n+1, δ−
n+1, . . .
(2.1)
where {δn : n ∈Z} and {e+ = [1, 0]⊤, e−= [0, 1]⊤} are the standard bases of ℓ2(Z) and C2. On
H, we define two types of unitary operators:
(a) state-dependent shift operators S± which are defined via the bilateral shift T : δn 7→δn+1
on ℓ2(Z) and the orthogonal projections P± = |e±⟩⟨e±| on C2 as
S± = T ±1 ⊗P± + 1Z ⊗P∓.
(2.2)
(b) coin operators C on H which act locally at position n via a unitary 2 × 2 matrix
C(n) =

a(n)
b(n)
c(n)
d(n)

,
(2.3)
where the unitarity of C(n) implies that |a(n)| = |d(n)| and |b(n)| = |c(n)| for all n ∈Z.
A quantum walk on H with strictly finite jump width is a finite product of such shifts and coins.
This construction is exhaustive: any banded unitary operator can be decomposed into such a
finite product, both in the general case [26] as well as in the translation-invariant setting [52].
The concrete systems we study are split-step quantum walks that are defined via
W = S+C1S−C2,

where the coins Cj act locally as Cj(n). A special type of split-step walks is obtained by setting
the first coin operator to the identity operation, i.e. C1 = 1. The resulting shift-coin walk has
the form
U = SC,
(2.5)
where S = S+S−and C = C2. Throughout this manuscript, we consistently denote split-step
walks by W and reserve U for shift-coin walks1. When the distinction is not essential, we shall
denote general quantum walks on H simply by W.
We say that a walk W or a coin C is translation-invariant if W or C commutes with lattice
translations. In this setting, the local coins are independent of position, i.e., C(n) ≡C(0) for
all n ∈Z. Without loss of generality, we omit a global phase such that det(C(n)) = 1, which
leads to
C(n) =

a, b ∈C; |a|2 + |b|2 = 1.
(2.6)
A popular choice is the Hadamard coin CH with a = b = 1/

In the translation-invariant setting, the dynamics is (partially) diagonalized by the Fourier
transform
(Fψ)(θ) =

2π
X
n∈Z
e−iθnψ(n),
(2.7)
where ψ(n) is an element of the local Hilbert space C2 at n ∈Z. It is straightforward to check
that a translation-invariant walk W becomes a matrix-valued multiplication operator in Fourier
space, that is,
(FWF −1 ˆψ)(θ) = ˆW(θ) ˆψ(θ).
(2.8)
Here, ˆψ(θ) is C2-valued and ˆW(θ) is a unitary 2 × 2 matrix for every θ ∈T := [0, 2π). We can
further diagonalize the unitary matrices ˆW(θ) pointwise which yields
ˆW(θ) =
X
s=±
eiωs(θ)Ps(θ),
(2.9)
where the dispersion relations ωs(θ) determine the eigenvalues and the Ps(θ) are (rank-1) or-
thogonal eigenprojections. Below, the dispersion relations play a central role in determining the
velocity of translation-invariant walks.
2.2. Electric fields
We introduce electric fields into quantum walks via the discrete minimal coupling scheme
described in [24], where electric fields appear as commutation phases between discrete-time
shifts and lattice translations.
In the present setting on Z, these commutation phases can
be implemented as multiplication by a position-dependent phase [24, 29].
We only consider
homogeneous and static electric fields Φ ∈T := [0, 2π) which are implemented by the diagonal
unitary operators

where Qδ±
n = nδ±
n is the position operator on H, and σ3 is the third Pauli matrix. Note that
the global phase eiΦ/2 can be dropped without loss of generality.
We mainly consider “rational electric fields” Φ = 2πn/m with n, m ∈Z coprime such that
eiΦ is a primitive mth root of unity. Since Φ/2π = n/m is rational, we refer to FΦ and ˜FΦ as
1The motivation for this notation is the following: In Theorem 3.3 below we will see that two time steps with
a shift-coin walk (“double-U”) are related to a single step with a split-step walk (W).

rational electric fields. Throughout the paper, we mostly refer simply to “the electric field Φ”
whenever is clear from the context whether FΦ or ˜FΦ is intended.
We incorporate these rational electric fields into shift-coin and split-step quantum walk dy-
namics by defining
UΦ := FΦU = FΦSC
and
WΦ := ˜FΦW = ˜FΦS+CS−C,
(2.11)
respectively. Dynamical and spectral properties of the electric shift-coin UΦ have been explored
previously in [24, 29, 30]. The crucial observation there was that, while UΦ itself is not, the
temporally regrouped walk Um
Φ is translation-invariant. This periodic structure of Um
Φ leads to
revivals in the dynamics under UΦ: in [29, Theorem 1] it is established that
U2m
Φ
+ 1
 = 2|a|m
for m odd,
Um
Φ + (−1)m/21
 = 2|a|m/2
for m even.
(2.12)
This “revival theorem” implies that UΦ reproduces any initial state periodically up to an error
that is exponentially small in m such that the walker exhibits very little net transport.
The observation that the temporally regrouped walk commutes with the lattice translations
opens up the toolbox of Fourier techniques. These tools are standard in the study of quantum
walks (see, e.g., [6, 7,29, 35]). The proof of the revival theorem hinges on the observation that
the dispersion relations of Um
Φ can be explicitly calculated [29] and are given as ω±(θ, m) where
cos(ω±(θ, m)) =
(
|a|m cos(m(θ + arg(a))),
m odd,
−|a|m cos(m(θ + arg(a))) + (−1)m/2(|a|m −1),
m even.
(2.13)
Note that in the special case here ω−= −ω+ because ˆW(θ) ∈SU(2) by (2.6). This implies
immediately that spec(UΦ) is absolutely continuous and consists of 2m bands. The dispersion
relations depend explicitly on the coin parameter a; we suppress this dependence to simplify
notation.
On the other hand, the electric split-step walk WΦ with translation-invariant coins is precisely
the model studied in [3]. Note that ˜FΦ is not precisely an electric field as defined in [24] due to
the additional exp[−iΦ(1Z ⊗σ3)/2]. However, this translation-invariant coin can be absorbed
and WΦ can be written (up to a global phase exp[iΦ/2]) as
WΦ = F2ΦS+ ˜CS−C,
where
˜C := e−i Φ
2 (1Z⊗σ3)C.
This justifies calling WΦ an electric walk. Note, that 2Φ/(2π) = 2m/n is reduced only if n is
odd.
2.3. The speed limit of electric quantum walks
A fundamental question for quantum walks is how fast information can propagate under the
given dynamics, especially when external fields are present. Quantum walks model the discrete-
time dynamics of single particles. Thus, in t ∈N timesteps, an initial state ψ evolves under
an arbitrary quantum walk W as ψ 7→W tψ. Moreover, let us denote by Q(t) := W −tQW t
the position operator at time t in the Heisenberg picture. The velocity of a (normalized) state
ψ ∈H with respect to W is given as
v(W, ψ) := lim sup
t→∞
1
t ∥Q(t)ψ∥≡lim sup
t→∞
1
t ∥QW tψ∥.
(2.14)
Then we define the maximal velocity as the supremum over all states ψ ∈Dom(Q) of the
asymptotic expected position in ballistic scaling (recall that Q is the position operator on H):
v(W) :=
sup
ψ∈Dom(Q)
∥ψ∥=1
v(W, ψ).
(2.15)

Clearly, for any t ∈N the domain of QW t contains all finitely supported states. Moreover, it
is straightforward to check that Dom(Q) is invariant2 under W, that is, if ψ ∈Dom(Q) then
W tψ ∈Dom(Q) for any t ∈N.
In [3, Theorem 3.2] it is proved that the velocity of any initial state Ψ = δ0 ⊗ψ(0) localized
at 0 with ψ(0) ∈C2 normalized is bounded from above by
v(WΦ, Ψ) ≤(4|a|)m.
(2.16)
This means that the velocity of Ψ decays exponentially in m whenever |a| ∈(0, 1/4) whereas
the bound becomes trivial for all other coin parameters. Numerics led the authors of [3] to
conjecture that the exponential decay of the velocity holds for all |a| ∈[0, 1]. Part (a) of our
main result implies this conjecture: it provides an exact bound for the velocity of any initial
state in the domain of Q and, moreover, it improves the prefactor in (2.16):
Theorem 2.1. Let m, n ∈N be coprime and let Φ = 2πn/m. Consider the electric split-step
walk WΦ = ˜FΦS+CS−C with translation-invariant coin C. Then, for |a| ∈[0, 1] as in (2.6):
(a) The maximal velocity of WΦ is
v(WΦ) = |a|m.
(2.17)
(b) WΦ satisfies the revival relation
W m
Φ + (−1)m−n1
 = 2|a|m.
(2.18)
(c) The spectrum of WΦ is absolutely continuous and given as
spec(WΦ) =
[
θ∈T, s=±
k=0,1,...,2m−1
n
ei 1
m(bωs(θ,m)+πk)o
where bωs(θ, m) =
(
ωs(θ, 2m),
n odd,
2ωs(θ, m),
n even,
(2.19)
and ω±(θ, m) is given by (2.13).
Thus, the walker’s ballistic spread becomes exponentially suppressed for all |a| ∈(0, 1). Note
that v is an asymptotic quantity that does not establish a bound for finite times, see Figure 1.
However, it is known that the faster-than-light contributions, so the contributions with velocities
larger than v, decay exponentially in time [28].
Remark 2.2. An upper bound on v(W) automatically implies an upper bound on the asymptotic
standard deviation of the time-evolved position operator in ballistic scaling:
σψ(Q(t)) :=
p
⟨ψ, Q(t)2ψ⟩−⟨ψ, Q(t)ψ⟩2 ≤
p
⟨ψ, Q(t)2ψ⟩= ∥Q(t)ψ∥.
(2.20)
Thus, bounding the maximal velocity also provides control over the rate of quantum spreading,
or uncertainty, in the system. See also Figure 1.
Theorem 2.1 is proved in Section 3. While ˜FΦ(T ±1 ⊗1) = e2iΦ(T ±1 ⊗1) ˜FΦ and thus W 2m
Φ
is translation-invariant, a direct approach via Fourier technics as for the electric shift coin walk
UΦ in [29] does not seem feasible: there, the structure of the multiplication operator U2m
Φ
resp.
Um
Φ in Fourier space played a significant role in determining the exact form of the dispersion
relations (2.13). The Floquet matrix of W 2m
Φ
does not posses this structure, which seems to
render its dispersion relations inaccessible. For the proof of Theorem 2.1 we therefore embark
a different, less direct approach: the key observation that U2
Φ acts as a two-step walk suggests
decomposing the position space into even and odd lattice sites. Then U2
Φ decomposes as a direct
sum of two split-step walks which allows us to establish a relation between the velocities of UΦ
and WΦ.
2This follows from checking that if ψ ∈Dom(Q) then Cjψ and S±ψ are in Dom(Q).

2. As the inset shows, the dynamics is
initially very similar until about the order of t = 20 where the errors committed
in each revival accumulated enough such that the next term in the continued
fraction expansion kicks in, see [29] for a thorough explanation of the interplay
between the continued fraction expansion of Φ and the revivals.
The revival formula (2.18) demonstrates that the system evolving under WΦ returns close to
its initial state, after every m steps up to an error decaying exponentially in m. On the one hand,
this mirrors the revivals in the shift-coin case. However, for m odd WΦ exhibits revivals after m
time steps, whereas the revivals for UΦ occur only after 2m steps, see Figure 1. These revivals
underpin the exponential suppression of the maximal velocity and highlight the fundamental
role of periodicity in suppressing ballistic transport.
As a direct consequence of the revival relation we conclude that irrational fields that are
well-approximable in terms of their continued fraction expansion lead to hierarchical motion:
an alternation between farther and farther excursion and better and better revivals on the time
scales of the denominators of their continued fraction approximants. As argued in [29], the
excursions preclude point spectrum while the revivals preclude absolutely continuous spectrum
via the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, wherefore the spectral type of such walks must be singular
continuous. On an arithmetic level, one can show this for example for Lebesgue fields via a
Gordon-type argument, see [18]. In the typical case, that is, for a full measure set of fields,
Anderson localization follows for WΦ from the proof in [30] via sieving.

In this section, we prove the main result, Theorem 2.1, by exploiting the decomposition of
the Hilbert space H = ℓ2(Z) ⊗C2 into two subspaces corresponding to even and odd lattice
sites. This decomposition enables us to relate the dynamics of split-step and shift-coin walk:
the product of two shift-coin operators decomposes as a direct sum of two split-step walks with

respect to this even-odd decomposition. Combining this with a bound on the maximal velocity
of electric shift-coin walks that follows from their dispersion relations in (2.13) is the key to
establishing the exact form of velocity bounds and revival phenomena for split-step walks in
rational electric fields.
3.1. The maximal velocity of UΦ
In the setting where W is an arbitrary translation-invariant quantum walk, it is well known
(see, e.g., [6, Theorem 4], [32, Theorem 9.4] or [28, Proposition 2.2]) that for any ψ ∈Dom(Q)
there exists a bounded self-adjoint operator V on H such that
lim
t→∞
1
t Q(t)ψ = V ψ.
(3.1)
This (group) velocity operator V is explicitly given as
V := F −1
"X
s
∂θωs(θ)Ps(θ)
#
F,
(3.2)
where ωs and Ps(θ) are the dispersion relations and the eigenprojections from (2.9), and the
eigenvalues ∂θωs(θ) in Fourier space are called “group velocities” [28]. Equation (3.1) shows
that the lim sup in the definition of the velocity (2.15) is in fact just a limit. Thus, the velocity
of W can be expressed as the maximum of the group velocities:
v(W) =
sup
ψ∈Dom(Q)
∥ψ∥=1
lim
t→∞

t ∥W −tQW tψ∥= sup
ψ∈H
∥ψ∥=1
∥V ψ∥=
max
s=±, θ∈T |∂θωs(θ)|,
(3.3)
where we used the fact that Dom(Q) is dense in H.
As mentioned above, the electric shift-coin walk UΦ with rational field Φ = 2πm/n is itself
not translation-invariant, so to apply the above we need to consider the velocity of the m-fold
regrouped walk v(Um
Φ ). For this walk, the dispersion relations are given in (2.13), and its speed
is obtained by computing:
Lemma 3.1. For the coin matrix C in (2.6), we have that
max
θ∈T |∂θω±(θ, m)| =
(
m|a|m,
m odd,
m|a|m/2,
m even,
(3.4)
with the dispersion relations ω±(θ, m) given in (2.13).

Proof of Lemma 3.1. Differentiating the dispersion relations from (2.13) with respect to θ and
solving for ∂θω±(θ, m) gives
∂θω±(θ, m) = (−1)m+1 m|a|m sin(m(θ + arg(a)))
sin(ω±(θ, m))
.
(3.5)
We square this expression and use (2.13) again. Considering the odd and even cases for m
separately yields
m odd: Set y1(θ) := cos2(m(θ + arg(a))) ∈[0, 1] such that
(∂θω±(θ, m))2 = m2|a|2m
1 −cos2(m(θ + arg(a)))
1 −|a|2m cos2(m(θ + arg(a))) = m2|a|2m
1 −y1(θ)
1 −|a|2my1(θ).
(3.6)
m even: Set y2(θ) := 1 −(−1)m/2 cos(m(θ + arg(a))) ∈[0, 2]. Then from (2.13)
cos(ω±(θ, m)) = (−1)m/2+1 (1 −|a|my2(θ)) .
(3.7)
Thus,
sin2(ω±(θ, m)) = |a|my2(θ) (2 −|a|my2(θ)) ,
(3.8)
and hence,
(∂θω±(θ, m))2 = m2|a|m
2 −y2(θ)
2 −|a|my2(θ).
(3.9)
The functions
f1(y) =
1 −y
1 −|a|2my,
f2(y) =
2 −y
2 −|a|my
(3.10)
are decreasing for all y ∈[0, 2] and hence achieve their maximum value 1 at y = 0.
□
Together with Lemma 3.8 below, this implies that the velocity of UΦ is given by
v(UΦ) = 1
mv(Um
Φ ) =
(
|a|m
m odd,
|a|m/2
m even,
(3.11)
where |a| ∈[0, 1] is the coin parameter from (2.6).
3.2. Sieving split-step walks
Our methods to prove the main result in Theorem 2.1 depend on the decomposition of the
lattice over which H is defined into even and odd labeled cells as
H = He ⊕Ho :=
h
ℓ2(2Z) ⊗C2i
⊕
h
ℓ2(2Z + 1) ⊗C2i
,
(3.12)
where we choose bases {δ±
e,n} and {δ±
o,n} for He and Ho, respectively, with ordering
(δ+
e,n, δ−
e,n) := (δ+
2n, δ−
2n)
(δ+
o,n, δ−
o,n) := (δ+
2n+1, δ−
2n+1).
(3.13)
Remark 3.2. For simplicity, we use the same symbols (Q, W, S±, C, . . .) to denote operators
defined both on the full Hilbert space H and on its subspaces He and Ho. In each case, the symbol
refers to the corresponding operator acting on the relevant space. This slight abuse of notation
should cause no confusion, as the relevant domains will always be clear from the context.
The following theorem shows that the square of a shift-coin walk decomposes as a direct sum
of two split-step walks with respect to the even-odd decomposition in (3.12). This result, which
we prove for completeness in Section 3.3 below, is the translation of folklore knowledge in the
literature of CMV matrices, see for example [34].

Theorem 3.3. Let U = SC, be a shift-coin walk on H = ℓ2(Z) ⊗C2. Then
U2 = W ⊕˜W,
(3.14)
where W = S+C1S−C2 and ˜W = S+ ˜C1S−˜C2 are specified by the local coins
C1(n) = C(2n + 1),
C2(n) = C(2n),
˜C1(n) = C(2n + 2),
˜C2(n) = C(2n + 1),
and the direct sum is with respect to even and odd lattice sites (3.12).
Note that when C is translation-invariant, (3.14) reads as U2 = W ⊕W where W = S+CS−C.
The introduction of electric fields depends on which quantum walk we regard as a fundamental
shift in time direction [24]. For example, it makes a structural difference whether we electrify U
or U2 via (2.11): Since FΦ is block-diagonal with each block equal to a phase times the identity,
it commutes with coins, whereas SFΦ = (1Z ⊗e−iΦσ3)FΦS, where σ3 denotes the third Pauli
matrix. This directly implies that for a shift-coin walk U
UFΦ = e−iΦ(1Z⊗σ3)FΦU.
Thus, squaring an electric shift-coin walk UΦ = FΦU yields
U2
Φ = FΦUFΦU = e−iΦ(1Z⊗σ3)F2ΦU2 = e−iΦ(1Z⊗σ3)F2Φ

W ⊕˜W

(3.15)
where W and ˜W are as in Theorem 3.3. To fully decompose U2
Φ with respect to even and odd
lattice sites, it remains to decompose the field FΦ = eiΦQ. Clearly, the position operator Q on
H decomposes as
Q = (2Q) ⊕(2Q + 1).
(3.16)
This implies that the field FΦ in (2.10) decomposes with respect to (3.12) as
FΦ = eiΦQ = e2iΦQ ⊕eiΦe2iΦQ = F2Φ ⊕eiΦF2Φ.
(3.17)
Substituting this expression into (3.15) and replacing Φ 7→Φ/2 yields the following corollary:
Corollary 3.4. Let UΦ = FΦU be a shift-coin walk subject to the electric field FΦ = eiΦQ. Then
U2
Φ/2 =

e−iΦ/2 ˜FΦW

eiΦ/2 ˜FΦ ˜W

(3.18)
where W and ˜W are the split-step walks as in Theorem 3.3 and the field ˜FΦ is given in (2.10).
This decomposition allows us to relate the velocities of the two types of walks: Lemma 3.7
below shows that the velocity of any walk that acts independently on even and odd lattice
sites without mixing them is twice the maximum of the subsystem velocities. Moreover, it is
intuitively clear that the speed of some kth power of a quantum walk is k-times the speed of the
walk, see Lemma 3.8 below. Applying these results to (3.18) in the translation-invariant case
yields, on the one hand

which together imply that the velocities of UΦ/2 and WΦ agree. This chain of arguments high-
lights why in the definition of WΦ we use the field ˜FΦ instead of FΦ: Lemma 3.8 only applies to
powers of operators. If we would consider the split-step walk with field FΦ instead of ˜FΦ, the
left side of (3.18) we amount to eiΦ/2(1⊗σ3)U2
Φ/2 for which we have no handle on its velocity.

To prove Theorem 2.1 we exploit (3.18), where we note that for the electric field Φ = 2πn/m,
the fundamental period of Φ/2 on the left side is ℓ:= 2m/ gcd(n, 2). Since n, m are coprime by
assumption, it is easy to see that
ℓ=
(
2m,
n odd,
m,
n even,
(3.21)
where in the second case m is automatically odd. Then part (a) of Theorem 2.1, that is v(WΦ) =
|a|m follows directly from (3.11).
To prove the revival relations (2.18) as well as part (c) of Theorem 2.1 about the spectrum
of WΦ, we start from (3.18). It directly follows that

yields

 = ∥W m
Φ −(−1)m1∥.

Again, since exp(iΦ/2) is a primitive ℓth-root of the unity, (3.21) shows that the spectral prop-
erties of WΦ depend on the parity of n.

3.3. Proof of Theorem 3.3
We begin by explicitly describing the action of a split-step quantum walk on basis elements
{δs
n : n ∈Z, s ∈{+, −}} with the ordering (2.1). This will allow us to easily identify even-odd
decompositions.
Lemma 3.5. Let C1(n), C2(n), n ∈Z be two sequences of unitary 2 × 2 matrices that serve
as local coins of the form (2.3). Then, the corresponding split-step walk W acts on the basis
{δs
n : n ∈Z, s = ±} of ℓ2(Z) ⊗C2 as
Wδ+
n = a2(n)

(3.28)
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of the state-dependent shift operators in (2.2)
and the coins in (2.3).

Let U be a shift-coin walk with local coins as in (2.3). To prove Theorem 3.3, we start by
noting the invariance of the even and odd subspaces He and Ho under the action of U2. Precisely,
U2He ⊂He
and
U2Ho ⊂Ho.
(3.29)
This can be seen from calculating the action on the basis states: at the even lattice sites the
product acts as
U2δ+
2n = a(2n)[a(2n + 1)δ+
2n+2 + c(2n + 1)δ−
2n] + c(2n)[b(2n −1)δ+
2n + d(2n −1)δ−
2n−2]
U2δ−
2n = b(2n)[a(2n + 1)δ+
2n+2 + c(2n + 1)δ−
2n] + d(2n)[b(2n −1)δ+
2n + d(2n −1)δ−
2n−2]
Similarly, on the odd lattice sites,
U2δ+
2n+1 = a(2n + 1)[a(2n + 2)δ+
2n+3 + c(2n + 2)δ−
2n+1] + c(2n + 1)[b(2n)δ+
2n+1 + d(2n)δ−
2n−1]
U2δ−
2n+1 = b(2n + 1)[a(2n + 2)δ+
2n+3 + c(2n + 2)δ−
2n+1] + d(2n + 1)[b(2n)δ+
2n+1 + d(2n)δ−
2n−1]
Comparing with (3.28), one immediately sees that the action of U2 on each subspace He and
Ho coincides with that of two separate split-step quantum walks with local coin operators as
described in the statement of Theorem 3.3.
Remark 3.6. The ordering of the basis in He and Ho is important here: taking instead
(δ+
e,n, δ−
e,n) := (δ+
2n, δ−
2n)
(δ+
o,n, δ−
o,n) := (δ−
2n−1, δ+
2n+1),
(3.30)
and comparing with the analogue of Lemma 3.5 for the transposed split-step walk, we find that
U2 acts on Ho as W ⊤= C⊤
2 S⊤
−C⊤
1 S⊤
+ with local coins
C1(n) = σ1C(2n + 1)⊤σ1,
C2(n) = σ1C(2n)⊤σ1.
(3.31)
3.4. Speed limit of direct sums and powers of quantum walks
In this section, we establish two structural results on the propagation velocity of quantum
walks that play a central role in the proof of Theorem 2.1 and are of independent interest. Both
of them are expectable: Lemma 3.7 says that the velocity of a direct sum of quantum walks
is determined by the fastest component, while Lemma 3.8 establishes that the velocity of the
kth power of a quantum walk is k-times the velocity of the walk. Together, these results are
useful for analyzing composite or periodically driven quantum walks and underpin our analysis
of ballistic propagation.
Lemma 3.7. Let W1 and W2 be arbitrary quantum walks on ℓ2(Z) ⊗C2. Then, the velocity
of their direct sum W1 ⊕W2 with respect to even and odd lattice sites (3.12) equals twice the
maximum of the velocities of W1 and W2, i.e.,
v (W1 ⊕W2) = 2 max{v(W1), v(W2)}.
(3.32)
Proof. First recall the decomposition of the position operator from (3.16).
Writing W12 :=
W1 ⊕W2 we observe that for any t ∈N and normalized ψ = ψe ⊕ψo, we have
QW t
12ψ = 2QW t
1ψe ⊕(2Q + 1)W t
2ψo,
(3.33)
The velocity of ψ with respect to W12 becomes

(3.34)
We emphasize that the terms on the right hand side are not velocities in general since ψe and
ψo might not be normalized.
For the second term on the right of (3.34). Two direct applications of triangle inequalities
yield

Use this inequality in (3.34) together with the basic fact that (observe that 1

⇒

(f(t) + g(t)) = lim sup

(3.37)
In particular, when ψ is supported only on He, i.e. ψ = ψe ⊕0Ho, and ∥ψ∥= ∥ψe∥= 1, (3.37)
reduces to
2v(W1, ψe) = v(W12, ψe ⊕0Ho).
(3.38)
Take the supremum over all normalized initial states ψe ∈Dom(Q), to see that
2v(W1) = sup
ψe
v(W12, ψe ⊕0Ho) ≤sup
ψ
v(W12, ψ) = v(W12)
(3.39)
Similarly, we have 2v(W2) ≤v(W12), and hence
v(W12) ≥2 max{v(W1), v(W2)}.
(3.40)
To prove the other direction of the inequality (3.40), we start with (3.37) and we consider two
cases for the state ψ ∈Dom(Q)
case 1: ∥ψ⋆∥∈{0, 1}, where ⋆∈{e, o}, i.e., ψ = ψe ⊕0Ho or ψ = 0He ⊕ψo.
case 2: ∥ψ⋆∥/∈{0, 1}, where ⋆∈{e, o}, i.e., ψ = ψe ⊕ψo ∈Dom(Q) with nonzero ψe and ψo.
For case 1, observe that (3.38) gives
v(W12, ψe ⊕0Ho) = 2v(W1, ψe) ≤2v(W1).
(3.41)
and similarly,
v(W12, 0He ⊕ψo) = 2v(W2, ψo) ≤2v(W2).
(3.42)
For case 2: we distribute the limsup in (3.37) to obtain

(3.44)
where we used the fact that ∥ψe∥2 + ∥ψo∥2 = 1.
Combining the two cases, we find that for initial state ψ ∈Dom(Q),
v(W12, ψ) ≤2 max{v(W1), v(W2)},
(3.45)
which shows that
v(W12) ≤2 max{v(W1), v(W2)}.
(3.46)
Combining (3.40) and (3.46) yields the desired equality (3.32).
□
We note in passing that it is immediate from the proof that Lemma 3.7 carries over to more
general quantum walks, for example, to those with internal degree of dimensions larger than 2.
Lemma 3.8. Let W be an arbitrary quantum walk. Then
v(W k) = k v(W).
Proof. For a fixed k ∈N, the one direction that v(W k) ≤k v(W) follows from the following
simple argument: For any normalized ψ ∈Dom(Q), recall that
v(W k, ψ) = lim sup
t→∞
1
t ∥QW ktψ∥,
(3.47)

Since (kt)t∈N is a subsequence of (t)t∈N, we obtain
v(W k, ψ) ≤kv(W, ψ) ≤kv(W).
(3.48)
Taking the sup shows that v(W k) ≤k v(W).
To prove the other direction, note that for any t ∈N, there are unique s ∈N and r ∈
{0, 1, . . . , k −1} such that t = ks + r. Then use Lemma 3.9 below with f(t) := t−1∥QW tψ∥,
ψ ∈Dom(Q) and ∥ψ∥= 1, to see that
v(W, ψ) = max

s∥[Q, W]∥−→0 as s →∞

The first-to-second step follows from expanding the commutator, and the last step follows from
the boundedness of [Q, W]. Thus, inequality (3.49) reduces to
v(W, ψ) ≤1

Lemma 3.9. Let k ∈N be fixed and let f : N →(R ∪{±∞}) be any sequence. Then

Note that this lemma intuitively follows from the fact that
N =

(3.53)
Proof. For every fixed r0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , k −1}, (ks + r0)s∈N is a subsequence of (t)t∈N, so
lim sup
t→∞
f(t) ≥lim sup
s→∞f(ks + r0)
(3.54)
Since this holds for every r0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , k −1}, then
lim sup
t→∞
f(t) ≥max
0≤r<k lim sup
s→∞f(ks + r).
(3.55)
The other direction is more involved. Let
L := lim sup
t→∞
f(t)
(3.56)
By definition of the lim sup, given any ϵ > 0, there are infinitely many t ∈N such that L −ϵ <
f(t). These values of t define a subsequence (tn)n∈N of (t)t∈N such that
L −ϵ < f(tn)
(3.57)
for all n ∈N. For each tn, there is an sn ∈N and rn ∈{0, 1, . . . , k −1}, such that tn = ksn + rn.
Since there are only k possible different values of rn, then for any fixed r0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , k −1},
there is a subsequence (tnm) of (tn) and a sequence (snm) ∈N →∞of distinct values (it is a
subsequence of (s)s∈N) such that
tnm = ksnm + r0.
(3.58)

Hence (3.57) yields that

m→∞f(ksnm + r0) ≤lim sup
s→∞f(ks + r0)

(3.55) and (3.60) prove (3.52).

Appendix A. Connection to generalized extended CMV matrices
The the conjecture from [3] we are proving and the bound (2.16) that we are improving are
formulated in the language of so-called Cantero-Moral-Vel´azquez (CMV) matrices, which are
objects of primary interest in the theory of orthogonal polynomials [49, 50]. There is a many-
to-one correspondence between the objects of interest here, the split-step walks introduced in
Section 2.1 and CMV matrices, called the CGMV connection due to the foundational papers
[15,16]. It was generalized to the setting of split-step quantum walks (resp. generalized extended
CMV matrices) in [20,21].
For the convenience of the reader and to directly connect our results to those of [3] we define
these objects here and briefly comment on how their dynamical properties, particularly their
maximal velocities and revival phenomena, can be inferred from those of quantum walks with
electric fields. To this end, we call (α, ρ) ∈S3 = {(z1, z2) ∈C2 : |z1|2 + |z2|2 = 1} a Verblunsky
pair and for such a pair define the unitary matrix
Θ(α, ρ) :=

(A.1)
with det(Θ(α, ρ)) = −1. Given a sequence of Verblunsky pairs (αn, ρn)n∈Z, we define block-
diagonal operators L and M on ℓ2(Z) via the even and odd subsequences:
L = L((α2n, ρ2n)n∈Z) =
M
n∈Z
Θ(α2n, ρ2n),
(A.2)
M = M((α2n+1, ρ2n+1)n∈Z) =

The correspondence between GECMV matrices and split-step walks follows from grouping
elements of Z into cells of two [15,20,21]. More explicitly, identifying ℓ2(Z) with ℓ2(Z) ⊗C2 via
the mapping (see the ordering (2.1))
δ2n−1 7→δ+
n
and
δ2n 7→δ−
n ,
(A.6)
which gives the following relationship between the defining objects, the Θ-matrices and the coin
operators:
Lemma A.1. Let (αn, ρn), n ∈Z be a sequence of Verblunsky pairs and define Θ(αn, ρn) via
(A.1). Then, identifying ℓ2(Z) with ℓ2(Z) ⊗C2 via the mapping (A.6), the GECMV matrix
E = LM can be interpreted as a split-step walk as
E = S+C1S−C2,
where
C1(n) = σ1Θ(α2n, ρ2n),
C2(n) = σ1Θ(α2n−1, ρ2n−1),
(A.7)
with S± as in (2.2) and σ1 is the first Pauli matrix acting on the C2-cells.
Proof. First, note that in terms of decomposition ℓ2(Z) = L
n∈Z ℓ2({2n −1, 2n}), L and M are
given as
L = T
 M
n∈Z
Θ(α2n, ρ2n)
!
T −1,
M =
M
n∈Z
Θ(α2n−1, ρ2n−1),
(A.8)
where T : δn 7→δn+1 is the shift on ℓ2(Z). That is, L is understood as a shifted block diagonal
matrix. Importantly, due to the conjugation with T, Θ(α2n, ρ2n) and Θ(α2n−1, ρ2n−1) in (A.8)
now both act on ℓ2({2n −1, 2n}).
Identifying bases as in (A.6), the shift T ±1 on ℓ2(Z) acts on ℓ2(Z) ⊗C2 as T ±1 ⊗P±σ1 + 1Z ⊗
P∓σ1, and thus differs from S± in (2.2) by a flipping operation on the coin space: we have
T ±1(1 ⊗σ1) = S±.
(A.9)
Plugging this into (A.8) yields
E = LM = S+
 M
n∈Z

 M
n∈Z
σ1Θ(α2n−1, ρ2n−1)

(A.10)
with C1, C2 as in (A.7).
□
In the special case where either all even or all odd Verblunsky coefficients vanish, e.g., α2n = 0
for all n, the GECMV matrix reduces to a shift-coin walk.
Thus, our setting directly translates to that of GECMV matrices with fixed Verblun-
sky pair (α, ρ):
we have U = SC = L((0, 1)n∈Z) M((α, ρ)n∈Z) and W = S+C1S−C2 =
L((α, ρ)n∈Z) M((α, ρ)n∈Z), and electric fields are incorporated analogously to (2.11). Hence,
the results of Theorem 2.1 on maximal velocity, revival relations, and spectral properties estab-
lished for the electric quantum walks in Theorem 2.1 carry over directly to the GECMV matrix
setting, where the role of the coin parameter a is played by the Verblunsky parameter ρ, and
the explicit formulas retain the same structure.
A word of warning is in order: the electrified UΦ and WΦ do not relate to GECMV matrices in
the above sense since their Verblunsky pairs are not in S3. Nevertheless, the CGMV connection
extends to this setting and yields a standard CMV matrix, see [30] resp. [20, Appendix B].
