ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY OF PLANAR ENTROPY WAVE FOR 3-D NAVIER-STOKES
EQUATIONS IN EULERIAN COORDINATES

Abstract. We investigate the large-time asymptotic behavior toward the planar entropy wave for the three-dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates, considering two types of initial perturbations—with and without the
assumption that the integral of the initial perturbation is zero.
Generic perturbations generate diffusion waves, and
structural conditions fail for multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates. These two aspects have
posed significant challenges and left the problem unresolved for years. On one hand, since [21], the study of the entropy
wave has been based on the left-right structural conditions. Without these structural conditions, the decay rates of lower-
order terms become too slow to close the a priori assumption. On the other hand, the presence of diffusion waves yields
problematic error terms in the perturbation system. In this work, we introduce a new transformation to ensure that both
left-right structural conditions hold for the perturbation system. Additionally, using the fact that the derivative of the
entropy wave maintains a fixed sign, we employ well-designed weighted energy estimates to control the slowly decaying
terms. This enables us to establish asymptotic stability and derive the optimal decay rate. Furthermore, we address the
case of initial perturbations with the zero mass condition and obtain the optimal decay rate by additionally developing
a Poincar´e type inequality and a key cancellation.

Actually, we only need the weaker constraints µ > 0 and λ + µ ≥0 throughout the paper.
In the present work, we consider the ideal polytropic gas, that is, the pressure p and the inner energy e can be
determined by the following state equations
p = Rρθ = Aργ exp(γ −1

which is a classical system of hyperbolic conservation laws.
One of the main features of the Euler system is the
formulation of singularities. That is, no matter how smooth the initial data is, the discontinuity of the solution may
form. To see the discontinuity structure of solutions, we study the Riemann problem for which the solution usually
consists of three important basic waves: rarefaction wave, shock wave, and contact discontinuity. Depending on the
type of discontinuity, contact discontinuities can be classified into entropy waves and vortex sheets. In entropy waves,
the entropy is discontinuous, whereas in vortex sheets, the discontinuity lies in the shear velocity. It is known that
shock waves and rarefaction waves are generated in the generally nonlinear characteristic fields and the entropy wave
is generated in the linear degenerate field.
In the present paper, we are interested in studying stability of planar wave patterns. For the purpose, the domain
under consideration is the infinite long flat torus Ω:= R × T2 in space of three dimensions, where T := R/Z. We would
emphasize that even in such simple multi-dimensional setting, there are several essential difficulties compared to the
1-d case, and the study of the whole space R3 will be left for the future. Moreover, we focus on the planar entropy
waves given as the weak solutions of the 1-d Euler equations as follows:

in terms of the unknowns (ρ, m1 = ρu1, E). Studies for entropy waves are somehow more subtle than those for other
wave patterns because of the linear degeneracy of entropy waves. Accordingly, there are some structural conditions
that need to be considered when studying entropy waves. The Jacobi matrix of the flux for (1.3) is
A (ρ, m1, E) =

From direct computations, (1.4) further gives that
∇l2 · r2 ̸= 0,
∇r2 · r2 = 0.
(1.5)
However, the classical left and right structural conditions as in [21] are given as follows:
∇l2 · r2 = 0,
and
∇r2 · r2 = 0,
respectively.
(1.6)
Therefore, from (1.5) the left structural condition is violated for the Navier-Stokes equations (1.3) in Eulerian coordi-
nates.


STABILITY OF PLANAR ENTROPY WAVE FOR 3-D NAVIER-STOKES IN EULERIAN COORDINATES

The two structural conditions in (1.6) were originally proposed by Liu-Xin [21] for establishing the meta-stability of
contact discontinuities for general conservation laws with artificial viscosity via the Green’s function method. Subse-
quently, Xin-Zeng [30] demonstrated that the same result holds even without the left structural condition. A critical
distinction, however, arises when considering conservation laws with physical viscosity instead of artificial viscosity. In
the artificial viscosity case, the contact wave constitutes an exact solution, whereas for physical viscosity—as in the
Navier-Stokes equations—it serves only as an approximate solution. This is intrinsic to the nature of contact waves
as diffusion waves, which are generally not exact solutions of hyperbolic-parabolic coupled systems. For the Navier-
Stokes equations in Lagrangian coordinates, this challenge was overcome by Huang et al. [7, 9] through an ingenious
construction of the contact wave and several key observations. Their approach, however, relies on the left structural
condition and does not extend to the Eulerian coordinate framework. Consequently, the stability of contact disconti-
nuities for the Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates remains a major open problem, as previously noted for
the one-dimensional case in [30]; the multi-dimensional case presents even greater difficulties. It is also noteworthy that
Huang-Matsumura-Xin [7] conjectured the optimal decay rate for the contact wave. The question recently has been
resolved by Liu-Wang-Xu [17] under both structural conditions for the 1-d Navier-Stokes equations in Lagrangian coor-
dinates. This success underscores the significant and ongoing challenge of deriving the optimal decay rate of solutions
to (1.3) in the absence of the left structural condition as in (1.5).
1.2. Literature review. For the 1-d case, there have been numerous results on the stability of waves. In 1960, Oleˇınik
et al. [13] studied the stability of shock and rarefaction waves for a single conservation law. In 1985, Matsumura-
Nishihara [25] and Goodman [3] independently used the anti-derivative method to prove the stability of shock waves for
systems, under the zero-mass condition. In 1986, Matsumura-Nishihara [26] proved the stability of rarefaction waves
for the Navier-Stokes equations. In 2005, Huang-Matsumura-Xin [7] established the stability of entropy waves for the
Navier-Stokes equations. This result was further extended to the Boltzmann equation without requiring the zero-mass
condition by Huang-Xin-Yang [9] in 2008.
For solutions involving multiple wave patterns, Huang-Matsumura [6] in 2009 constructed diffusion waves and proved
the stability of composite waves containing two shock waves for the non-isentropic Navier-Stokes equations without
imposing the zero-mass condition. In 2010, Huang-Li-Matsumura [5] proved the stability of composite waves consisting
of two rarefaction waves and entropy waves via a new inequality. In 2021, Kang-Vasseur-Wang [14] studied the large-
time behavior of composite waves consisting of a shock and a rarefaction wave in the isentropic Navier-Stokes equations
by introducing a time-dependent shift.
The above results are obtained via the energy method. On the other hand, the Green’s function method, initiated
in [18, 19], has proven powerful in studying the pointwise behavior of waves. Using a novel construction of approximate
Green’s functions, Liu-Zeng [23] obtained pointwise estimates of shock waves in 2009. Their method applies to physical
viscosity cases, such as the Navier-Stokes and MHD equations [24]. In 2017, Liu-Wang [20] obtained pointwise estimates
of rarefaction waves for scalar conservation laws. For the derivation of nonlinear stability from linear and spectral
stability, we refer to [34]. Since this paper focuses on entropy waves, relevant results will be introduced in more detail
later. We also note that many interesting results are not included here; see [27].
Regarding entropy waves, for the Navier-Stokes equations in Lagrangian coordinates, both structural conditions
hold. However, viscous terms introduce errors, which complicates the analysis. These errors cause the energy of anti-
derivatives to grow in time. Huang et al. [7, 9] found that this growth can be compensated by the decay of the energy of
derivatives. They obtained a decay rate of (1+t)−1/4 and conjectured an optimal rate of (1+t)−1/2, based on the results
of Liu-Xin and Xin-Zeng [21, 30]. This conjecture has been studied by several groups, including Huang-Wang-Wang [8]
and Yang [31], where the best known decay rate is (1 + t)−1/3. More recently, [17] revisited this conjecture for the
Navier-Stokes equations in Lagrangian coordinates. The studies of entropy waves in the setting that both structural
conditions hold are now quite complete.
However, in the Eulerian coordinates for Navier-Stokes equations, the left structural condition fails, and consequently,
very few results are available. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, there are no known results, especially without
the zero-mass condition, proving the stability of entropy waves for the Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates,
even in the 1-d case. In this paper, we consider the multi-dimensional case and obtain the optimal decay rate (1+t)−1/2
for the Eulerian coordinates. The presence of the diffusion wave plays a crucial role in achieving this optimal rate.
For multi-dimensional planar waves, in 1990, Xin [29] studied planar rarefaction waves for a single conservation law.
In 2018, Li-Wang-Wang [15, 16] proved the stability of planar rarefaction waves with physical viscosity in R × T and
R × T2. Due to the fact that approximate rarefaction waves are not exact solutions for viscous conservation laws,
the multi-dimensional perturbations cannot be localized. Instead, Huang-Xu-Yuan [10] proved stability under periodic
(non-local) perturbations. Recently, Huang-Xin-Xu-Yuan [11] and Yuan-Zhao [33] proved the stability of the viscous
vortex sheet in the 3-D isentropic Navier-Stokes equation under periodic (non-local) perturbations.
There are also many notable results on planar shock waves.
Notably, Humpherys-Lyng-Zumbrun [12] provided
numerically well-conditioned and analytically justified computations verifying the nonlinear stability of planar viscous

shocks for the Navier-Stokes equations. Freist¨uhler-Szmolyan [1, 2] proved spectral stability for small-amplitude viscous
shocks in systems with artificial viscosity. More recently, Yuan [32] and Wang-Wang [28] made significant progress on
the rigorous proof of nonlinear stability for Navier-Stokes shock waves: [28] applied the a-contraction method with a
time-dependent shift, while [32] introduced a framework involving multi-dimensional anti-derivatives. We also refer to
Liu-Yu [22], where the propagation of planar shock waves is studied in a quantitative, pointwise manner, and more
complex wave patterns, including Rayleigh-type waves, are observed.
1.3. Difficulties and strategy. To the best of our knowledge, there are no such stability results concerning the m-d
viscous entropy wave. It should be pointed out that in the present understanding, the structural conditions are crucial
for viscous entropy waves by the energy method and Green’s function approach. Thus, the stability of the viscous
entropy wave is interesting and completely different from the other two wave patterns.
The stability of planar contact waves in multi-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations involves several
essential differences from the previous results as far as we know. In what follows, we introduce the difficulties and
novelties with more details.
Difficulties:
• The limitation of structural conditions (1.6).
Although the derivative of the contact discontinuity maintains a fixed sign, ∂1¯ρ and ∂1¯θ cannot share the
same sign; see (2.1), (2.2) and (2.4). That is one of the main differences between entropy wave and other basic
wave patterns such as rarefaction wave and shock wave. Fortunately, previous research works [21, 7, 9] showed,
with the help of two sides of structural conditions, that the lower order terms of perturbation (ϕ, φ, ζ) :=
(ρ −¯ρ, u −¯u, θ −¯θ) are
Z
Ω
(1 + t)−1e−cx2
1+t

ϕ2 + φ2 + ζ2
dx.
In the 1-d case, [9] found that although the energy of anti-derivatives increases with the rate (1 + t)
1
2 , the
L∞-norm can be bounded since the energy of perturbation decays at the rate of (1 + t)−1
2 . Thus, both of the
two structural conditions are crucial. If the left structural condition fails, the lower order terms become
Z
Ω
(1 + t)−1
2 e−cx2
1+t

ϕ2 + φ2 + ζ2
dx.
Then, arguments similar to those in [7, 9] can only yield uniform bounds for the first-order energy of anti-
derivatives within the anti-derivative framework, which is not enough to close the a priori assumptions. Without
the approaches of anti-derivatives, it is also hard to control such terms. Note that one can construct the entropy
wave as an exact solution for conservation laws with artificial viscosity; thus there will not be growth of energy
for anti-derivatives and this problem is somewhat simpler in this case.
In sum, the stability of entropy wave for systems with physical viscosity and without left structural condition
is very difficult and essentially different from other cases introduced previously.
• The optimal decay rate.
Note that the structural conditions in (1.6) are at the level of the first order of anti-derivatives, which helps
one to obtain a good estimate for zero-order energy. In the higher-order estimates, it fails and terms with low
decay rates arise. In [7], the authors conjectured that the optimal rate should be (1 + t)−1
2 due to the presence
of diffusion wave. Recently, [17] solved this problem in Lagrange coordinates, but not for Eulerian coordinates.
As explained previously, the structural conditions are crucial in computing the decay rates. Thus, our cases are
more subtle.
Based on these difficulties, we solve the problems by the following strategies.
Strategies:
• The decomposition of zero and non-zero mode in Fourier space.
The perturbations can be decomposed into
(˚ϕ, ˚
ψ, ˚
w) =
Z
T2(ρ −˜ρ, m −˜m, E −˜E)(x, t)dx2dx3,
(ϕ̸=, ψ̸=, w̸=) = (ϕ, ψ, w) −(˚ϕ, ˚
ψ, ˚
w),
where (˜ρ, ˜m, ˜E) is defined as the coupling of entropy waves and diffusion waves in (2.7); more details can be
found in Section 2. By this spirit, we can decompose the perturbation system into two coupled parts. The key
observation is that the non-zero mode of perturbations decays exponentially.
• The integrated system and a new transformation.
We study the perturbation in an integrated system with
(Φ, Ψ, W) =
Z x1
−∞
Z
T2(ρ −˜ρ, m −˜m, E −˜E)(y, t)dy′dy1.

Next, we will apply the following transformation
˜Φ = ˜θΦ,
˜Ψ = Ψ −˜uΦ,
˜W = W −˜u · ˜Ψ −

˜θ + |˜u|2
2

Φ,
where ˜u and ˜θ are the non-conserved quantities of velocity and temperature under the new ansatz (2.8),
respectively. Through this transformation, the new system is simplified a lot and satisfies both the two structural
conditions, see (3.15).
• Estimates on the non-zero mode.
We observe that the Poincar´e inequality holds for non-zero modes. Thus the exponential decay rate for them
is expected.
• The optimal decay rate.
Note that although the constructed entropy wave (2.2) is monotonic, the sign of derivatives of ¯θ and ¯ρ are
opposite, see (2.4). Thus, one cannot use arguments similar to those for shock waves or rarefaction waves that
essentially rely on the sign of derivatives of profiles. In the current case, we perform energy estimates using the
diagonalized system to fully capture the intrinsic feature and determine the dissipation structure as specified
in (3.26) and (3.28). In particular, we obtain the dissipation term
Gk := Cδ−1
2
Z
R
∂1¯ρ
∂k
1b1
2 + ∂1¯ρ
∂k

2 dx1,
see (3.26). It is also worth noting that, since ∂k+1¯ρ cannot be directly controlled by (1 + t)−k
2 ∂1¯ρ in terms of
(2.3), we further develop weighted estimates of the form
R
R ˜ω−1
2 |f|2dx1 as in (3.44) and (3.45) based on the
obtained dissipation term Gk, where ˜ω−1
2 is given in (2.12) with ˜c0 < c0 and c0 given in (2.3). Then the terms
with lower decay rate can be controlled.
• On the case of zero initial mass.
There are several key cancellations we need to achieve in this case. For instance, (4.4) shows that the slow
decay terms will not appear in the 2-characteristic field. And we need a Poincar´e type inequality Theorem 4.5
to deal with the critical terms.
We believe that the transformation and the weighted energy method proposed here, rooted in the structural properties
of entropy waves, have the potential of applications to a variety of important systems, including the Navier-Stokes-
Poisson and magnetohydrodynamics equations.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will construct the ansatz and then introduce the main
results. Then we will introduce the perturbation system, the key transformations, energy estimate for zero mode and
energy estimate for non-zero mode for the case without initial zero mass in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, we obtain
the optimal decay rate for the case with initial zero mass.
2. Construction of ansatz and main theorems
2.1. Planar viscous entropy wave for 3-d Navier-Stokes equations. In this subsection, we give the explicit
expression of planar entropy wave to the Navier-Stokes equations (1.1). We start from the 1-d Euler system (1.1) along
the x1-direction:

∂t(ρE) + ∂1 (ρEu1 + pu1) = 0,
with the initial data:
(ρ, u1, u2, u3, θ) (x1, 0) =
(
(ρ−, 0, 0, 0, θ−) ,
x1 < 0,
(ρ+, 0, 0, 0, θ+) ,
x1 > 0.
In this paper, we study the weak entropy wave, that is, the strength of wave δ := |ρ+ −ρ−| + |θ+ −θ−| is small. It is
known that entropy wave is generated in the linear degenerate characteristic field
Rρ+θ+ = p+ = p−= Rρ−θ−.
(2.1)
In the case of Navier-Stokes equations, we will modify the entropy wave as a smooth profile, called the viscous entropy
wave.

2.2. The extra initial mass and the diffusion waves. We will construct diffusion waves to carry the extra initial
mass, which is inspired by [18, 27, 9], to solve this problem. Note that the extra initial mass is distributed along the x1-
direction. The Jacobi matrices for the flux of 1-d Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates (1.3) at (ρ+, m1+, E+)
and (ρ−, m1−, E−) are given, respectively, as

2.3. Main results. We define the perturbation as

(ϕ0, φ0, ζ0, ψ0, w0) := (ϕ, φ, ζ, ψ, w)(x, 0),
and further the anti-derivatives for conserved quantities as
(Φ, Ψ, W) :=

−∞
Z
T2(ρ −˜ρ, m −˜m, E −˜E)(y, t)dy′dy1,
(Φ0, Ψ0, W0) := (Φ, Ψ, W)(x1, 0).
Then we state the main results of this paper as follows.
Theorem 2.1 (Non-zero initial mass). Let Ω= R × T2. Assume that (ρ+, u+, θ+) and (ρ−, u−, θ−) are the constant
states of entropy wave satisfying (2.1), and (¯ρ, ¯u, ¯θ) (x1, t) is the planar viscous entropy wave connecting these two states
as defined in (2.2) and (2.4). Then there exist positive small constants ε0, δ such that if
δ := |ρ+ −ρ−| + |θ+ −θ−| ,
∥(Φ0, Ψ0, W0)∥2
H3(R) + ∥(ϕ0, φ0, ζ0)∥2
H3(Ω) + ∥(ϕ0, ψ0, w0)∥2
L1(Ω) := ε2 ≤ε2
0,
then the Cauchy problem (1.1) admits a unique global smooth solution (ρ, u, θ) satisfying
(ρ −¯ρ, u −¯u, θ −¯θ) ∈C

Remark 2.2. We emphasize that according to the results of [21, 30] where they used the method of approximate
Green’s functions to obtain pointwise estimates, the decay rate obtained in (2.13) is optimal. Moreover, we also obtain
the exponential decay rate for the non-zero mode.
Remark 2.3. To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 2.1 can be regarded as the first result for the nonlinear asymp-
totic stability of the multi-dimensional entropy wave and also for systems with physical viscosity but without the left
structural condition as in (1.5).
Theorem 2.4 (Zero initial mass). Under the same assumptions as Theorem 2.1 and further assuming that the initial
mass is zero, that is
Z
Ω
[(ρ0, m0, E0)(x) −(¯ρ, ¯m, ¯E)(x1, 0)]dx = 0,

Remark 2.5. We point out that the time decay rate in (2.14) is optimal in terms of the result obtained by using
pointwise estimate for conservation laws with artificial viscosity in [30].
Remark 2.6. It should be noted that the optimal decay rate (2.14) cannot be achieved simply by applying the
conclusions and methods of deriving (2.13) in case of non-zero initial mass. For zero initial mass, there are several
key cancellations we need to make use of. For instance, (4.4) shows that the slow decay terms do not appear in the
2-characteristic field. And we need a Poincar´e type inequality as in Theorem 4.5 to deal with the critical terms.

2.4. The decomposition for zero and non-zero modes. We decompose the solution into the principal and transver-
sal parts corresponding to the zero and non-zero modes in Fourier space, respectively. For the purpose, we define D0
and D̸= by
D0f := ˚
f :=
Z
T2 fdx2dx3,
D̸=f := f̸= := f −˚
f,
(2.15)
for any function f integrable on T2. We also introduce the following two notations for the sake of simplicity:
N2(U) := m ⊗m
ρ
−(γ −1)|m|2
2ρ I,
N3(U) := mE
ρ
+ pm
ρ −m

where I denotes the identity matrix. With these, the Navier-Stokes equations can be rewritten as


3. Proof of Theorem 2.1: the non-zero initial mass
In this section, we are devoted to proving Theorem 2.1 in case of non-zero initial mass. We first derive the perturbation
equations, and then introduce a decomposition of zero and non-zero modes for the conserved quantities. The key part
is to obtain the a priori estimates under suitable a priori assumptions for the zero and non-zero modes, respectively.
Note that the zero and non-zero modes are not completely decoupled.
3.1. Systems for perturbations. We start to derive the systems of perturbations. Recall
(ϕ, ψ, w, φ, ζ) := (ρ −˜ρ, m −˜m, E −˜E, u −˜u, θ −˜θ).
(3.1)
By (1.1) and (2.9), the system of perturbations can be written as

ρ∂tζ + ρu · ∇ζ + (γ −1)ρθdivφ = κ△ζ + ˆR3,
(3.2)
where
ˆR1 := −∂1 ˜H1 −φ · ∇˜ρ −div˜uϕ,

We further study the perturbations for the zero mode of (ρ, m, E). The anti-derivatives for the zero mode is crucial
in our analysis, and thus we denote

Ψ :=

(i) Local existence theorem.

Proposition 3.1 (Local existence). There exist constants b, M, m > 0 such that if
∥(Φ0, Ψ0, W0)∥H3 + ∥(ϕ0, φ0, ζ0)∥H3 + ∥(ϕ0, ψ0, w0)∥L1 ≤M and inf
x (ϕ0 + ¯ρ(x1, 0)) ≥m > 0,
then there exists a positive time T0 = T0(m, M) > 0 such that (1.1) admits a unique solution (ρ, u, θ) satisfying
(ϕ, φ, ζ, Φ, Ψ, W) ∈X 1
2 m,bM(T0),
as well as
∥(Φ, Ψ, W)∥L∞≤bM.
(ii) The a priori assumptions.

impose the a priori assumptions on the principal and transversal parts separately. That is, for a positive c > 0,

Note that we need to close the above a priori assumptions. Indeed, we are able to prove the following a priori estimates.
Proposition 3.2 (a priori estimates). Assume that (ϕ, φ, ζ) is the unique solution given in Theorem 3.1 and satisfies
the a priori assumptions (3.7). Then the following estimates hold

where C, c > 0 are the universal constants independent of any small parameters throughout the paper.
By Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.1, using the standard continuity argument, we obtain Theorem 2.1. For simplicity,
we omit the proof of Theorem 3.1. In what follows, we focus only on the proof of Theorem 3.2.
(iii) The decay rate.

∥(ϕ, φ, ζ)∥L∞≤C∥(ϕ̸=, φ̸=, ζ̸=)∥L∞+ C∥(˚ϕ, ˚φ,˚ζ)∥L∞.

2 .
We still need to study the differences between the ansatz (˜ρ, ˜u, ˜θ) and the entropy wave (¯ρ, ¯u, ¯θ). By (2.7), we have
∥( ˜m −¯m, ˜E −¯E)∥L∞(Ω) ≤C(δ + ε0)(1 + t)−1

Similarly

2 .
Then (2.13) has been proved.
In the next section, we are going to give the proof of Theorem 3.2.
3.3. Estimates on zero modes. One of the key points in our proof is to introduce the following transformation
˜Φ = ˜θΦ,
˜Ψ = Ψ −˜uΦ,
˜W = W −˜u · ˜Ψ −

In what follows, we present the relationship between different variables more clearly. For the first-order derivatives,
we have
∂1Ψi = ∂1 ˜Ψi + ˜ui∂1Φ + ∂1˜uiΦ := ∂1 ˜Ψi + Bir,

Notice that we still need to control

R ˜ω−1

∂k

2 dx1 in (3.32) and (3.33). From (2.12) and (2.3), we have

∂1¯ρ ≈¯δ(1 + t)−1

with ˜c0 < c0. Therefore,
R

∂k

2 dx1 cannot be directly controlled by Gk in (3.26). We need to develop further
weighted heat kernel inequalities (3.44) and (3.45) to obtain the control of

∂k

2 dx1 for 1 ≤k ≤2. To derive
these estimates, let

It follows that

Lemma 3.8. Under the same assumptions as Theorem 3.2, one has the following estimates for the zero modes

2 .
Proof. In the sequel, we use the following fact which comes from (3.27):
E1 ≤CK0 + C¯δ(1 + t)−1E0,
E2 ≤CK1 + C¯δ(1 + t)−1K0 + C¯δ(1 + t)−2E0.
By Gronwall’s inequality and (3.20), one has

(Ki + Gi)dτ ≤C(ε2 + ¯δ)(1 + t)

ans it holds that

(3.60)
Then, by (3.27) and (3.58) to (3.60), the desired decay rate can be obtained as

Using the same argument as (3.19), one can prove Theorem 3.8.

Proof. Note that the Poincar´e inequality holds for (ϕ̸=, φ̸=, ζ̸=) in (3.61). Then, applying Gr¨onwall’s inequality to
(3.67), we have completed the proof of Theorem 3.11.
□
3.5. Higher order estimates. The main objective of this section is to make energy estimates in the original pertur-
bation equations and to verify the a priori assumptions. To close the a priori estimates, we need to return back to the
original system (3.2), that is







∂tϕ + u · ∇ϕ + ρdivφ = ˆR1,
ρ∂tφ + ρu · ∇φ + R(θ∇ϕ + ρ∇ζ) = µ△φ + (µ + λ)∇divφ + ˆR2,
ρ∂tζ + ρu · ∇ζ + Rρθdivφ = κ△ζ + ˆR3.
(3.77)
Note that the energy estimates for the zero- and first-order derivatives are already done. In order to verify the a priori
assumptions, we only need to perform further energy estimates for the second- and third-order derivatives.
We emphasise the strategy of proof. Since we already have estimates of lower order, it is most important to note the
sign of the energy of the highest order derivative when estimating. Applying ∂j∂i(i, j = 1, 2, 3) to the mass equation
(3.77)1 and ∂j(j = 1, 2, 3 ) to the i-th (i = 1, 2, 3) component of the momentum equation (3.77)2 and ∂j(j = 1, 2, 3 ) to
the energy equation (3.77)3, we have







∂t∂ijϕ + u · ∇∂ijϕ + ρdiv∂ijφ = ∂ij ˆR1 + ˆQ1,
ρ∂t∂jφ + ρu · ∇∂jφ + R(θ∇∂jϕ + ρ∇∂jζ) = µ△∂jφ + (µ + λ)∇div∂jφ + ∂j ˆR2 + ˆQ2,
ρ∂t∂jζ + ρu · ∇∂jζ + Rρθdiv∂jφ = κ△∂jζ + ∂j ˆR3 + ˆQ3,
(3.78)
where
ˆQ1 := −∂ij (u · ∇ϕ + ρdivφ) + (u · ∇∂ijϕ + ρdiv∂ijφ) ,
ˆQ2 := −∂jρ∂tφ −∂j (ρu) · ∇φ + R(∂jθ∇ϕ + ∂jρ∇ζ),
ˆQ3 := −∂jρ∂tζ −∂j(ρu) · ∇ζ −R∂j(ρθ)divφ.
By the a priori assumptions (3.7), we have the result
∥∇k ˆQi∥L2 ≤C(¯δ + χ)∥∇(ϕ, φ, ζ)∥Hk+1,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(3.79)
It remains to estimate ˆRi, i=1,2,3 (3.3). Note that the highest order of derivatives for (ϕ, φ, ζ) is zero order in ˆR1, ˆR2,
first order in ˆR3. Thus, by a priori assumption (3.7), one has
∥∇k( ˆR1, ˆR2)∥L2 ≤C¯δ(1 + t)−5

Combining Theorem 3.8, Theorem 3.11 and Theorem 3.12, we have proved Theorem 3.2.
4. Proof of Theorem 2.4: the zero initial mass
The differences between Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.4 lie in the estimates of zero modes. We show these estimates
and omit similar ones.
We start from (2.5) and D0(2.16) since there are no diffusion waves if the initial mass is zero. Using the same

kernel as a weight function.
Lemma 4.4. [5] For 0 < T ≤+∞, assume that h(x1, t) satisfies
hx1 ∈L2(0, T; L2(R)),
ht ∈L2(0, T; H−1(R)).
Then the following estimate holds:

Then we give the following Poincar´e type inequality, which plays an important role in our energy estimates.
Lemma 4.5. For ω−n defined in (2.11), and assume (4.2) holds. Then there exists some positive constant C depending

one has
