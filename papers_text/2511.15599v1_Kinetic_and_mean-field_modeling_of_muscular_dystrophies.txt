Abstract
We present a new class of models for assessing the cell dynamics characterising muscu-
lar dystrophies. The proposed approach comprises a system of integro-diﬀerential equations
for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the densities of muscle ﬁbers
and immune cells implicated in muscle inﬂammation, degeneration, and regeneration, which
underpin disease development. Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model,
we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-ﬁeld limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equa-
tions, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of
diﬀerential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of pa-
tients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-ﬁeld
model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form
of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time
convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are il-
lustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations. The modeling approach
presented here has the potential to oﬀer new insights into the balance between degeneration
and regeneration mechanisms in the progression of muscular dystrophies, and provides a basis
for future extensions, including the modeling of therapeutic interventions.

Introduction
Muscular dystrophies (MD) are commonly deﬁned as congenital myogenic disorders charaterized
by a progressive damage of the muscular tissue with variable distribution and severity, see e.g. [13]
and references therein. Among the most common groups of dystrophies, the Duchenne and Becker
MDs are the most common and serious forms of this disease. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(DMD), onset typically occurs in early childhood with generalized weakness of the limbs. This
leads to a progressive loss of ambulation from early adolescence onward, accompanied by a decline
in respiratory capacity and progressive cardiac involvement, ultimately resulting in death [12].
At the cellular level, in healthy muscle regeneration, macrophages clear cellular debris, resolve
inﬂammation, and secrete factors that promote tissue repair. In dystrophic conditions, such as
DMD, repeated muscle ﬁber damage triggers the inﬁltration of immune cells, including cytotoxic
T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages [32]. These cells release pro-inﬂammatory mediat-
ors that disrupt the normal regenerative process, promote chronic inﬂammation, and exacerbate

muscle degeneration, fat replacement, reactive myoﬁbrosis, and chronic inﬂammation [10]. Over
time, persistent immune activation contributes to ﬁbrosis and can extend to cardiac muscle, leading
to cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysfunction.
In fact, while mechanical injury and membrane defects are recognized as key contributors to
the pathology of dystrophic diseases, they do not fully account for the onset and progression of
MDs. Increasing evidence points to inﬂammation-driven mechanisms as early triggers of lesion
formation in dystrophin-deﬁcient muscle – see e.g.
[32] and references therein.
The immune
response is believed to play a signiﬁcant role in driving muscle damage. Supporting this view,
histological analyses of dystrophic muscle frequently reveal extensive inﬁltration by cytotoxic T
lymphocytes, macrophages, and other immune cells. In this respect, the pathology progresses
through a cascade of events that can be broadly outlined as follows: macrophages are the ﬁrst
to inﬁltrate the damaged muscle tissue, where they begin clearing cellular debris. During this
process, they attract cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which begin attacking not only compromised cells
but also healthy muscle cells, thereby exacerbating the damage.
Only few mathematical models are currently available to describe cell dynamics in MD pro-
gression and to capture the interplay between inﬂammation, degeneration, and regeneration – see
[16] for a review on this topic. Among them we mention the compartmental models formulated as
ordinary diﬀerential equations employed in [8, 17, 18]. Developing mathematical models capable of
integrating the roles of diﬀerent immune cell populations and their mediators among large cohorts
of MD patients remains an open challenge. Addressing this challenge could provide insight into
disease progression and could support the design of targeted therapeutic strategies.
An increasing number of real world phenomena have been fruitfully described by kinetic and
mean-ﬁeld models. Particular attention has been paid in the past decade to self-organizing systems
in life sciences. Without intending to review the vast literature on the subject, we refer the reader
to [5, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27] ad the references therein for an introduction. Within this framework,
in the present paper we develop a kinetic model for the dynamics of the statistical distributions
of the densities of muscle cells and immune cells in a large cohort of MD patients.
Building
upon [8], we focus on a simpliﬁed scenario wherein normal muscle cell degeneration is driven by
cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the recruitment and activity of which are mediated by macrophages.
Next, considering an appropriately scaled version of this kinetic model, we formally derive, as the
corresponding mean-ﬁeld limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently
derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of diﬀerential equations for the mean densit-
ies of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, building
on the approach introduced in [31], and later extended in [4, 21], we study long-time asymptotics
for the mean-ﬁeld model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which
are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the
long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions, in an appropriate Sobolev norm.
Finally, the analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical
simulations.
In contrast to compartmental models formulated as ordinary diﬀerential equations, the kinetic
and mean-ﬁeld models presented here makes it possible to capture emergent macroscopic dy-
namics resulting from microscopic processes taking place at the cellular level. Moreover, beyond
theoretical studies, the proposed modeling approach oﬀers a natural setting to integrate medical
information retrieved from heterogeneous cohorts of MD patients, for example extracted from
magnetic resonance imaging data, see e.g. [1, 6, 7]. In fact, by aggregating data from across a co-
hort of patients, one may reconstruct statistical descriptors of the underlying cell dynamics, which
can in turn be used to forecast disease progression at the patient cohort level. In this respect,
the kinetic model presented here and its mean-ﬁeld limit represent the ﬁrst modeling approach
oﬀering the potential of combining a mathematical model of cell dynamics with heterogeneous
patient data, so as to provide predictive insights into MD progression.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the kinetic model,
along with the underlying microscopic rules modeling cell dynamics, and we then derive the mean-
ﬁeld and macroscopic counterparts of this model. In Section 3, we study the long-time behaviour
of the mean-ﬁeld model. In Section 4, we present a sample of results of numerical simulations
2


through which we illustrate the theoretical results obtained in the previous sections. In Section 5,
we conclude with a summary of key ﬁndings and a brief discussion of future directions for the
modeling approach proposed here.

Kinetic and mean-ﬁeld models
Building upon [8], for simplicity we group the muscle ﬁbers into normal and damaged cells and,
among immune cells, we take into account the action of macrophages and cytotoxic T lympho-
cytes only. We thus consider four populations of cells, which are key players in the dystrophic
progression: normal cells, N, damaged cells, D, macrophages, M, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes,
C. Note that, to distil the essence of the problem, compared to [8] we do not model explicitly the
dynamics of helper T cells and regenerating muscle cells.
For a given large cohort of patients under consideration, we denote by fJ(x, t) the statistical
distribution of the (number) density of cells of type J ∈{N, D, M, C} over the patients – i.e.
fJ(x, t) dx is the fraction of cohort patients whose density of cells of type J falls within the
interval [x, x + dx) ⊂R+ at time t ≥0. Naturally, the distribution function fJ is such that
Z
R+
fJ(x, t)dx = 1
∀t ≥0,
J ∈{N, D, M, C}.
(1)
We then deﬁne the moment of order k ≥0 of the distribution function fJ as
m(k)
J (t) =
Z
R+
xkfJ(x, t)dx,
and, for ease of notation, we denote the moment of order k = 1, i.e. the mean, as
mJ(t) = m(1)
J (t) =
Z
R+
xkfJ(x, t)dx,
(2)
and the variance as
VJ(t) = m(2)
J
−(mJ)2 =
Z
R+
(x −mJ)2fJ(x, t)dx.

We refer the interested reader to [9] for a related modeling approach employed in a diﬀerent
biological context.
2.1
Microscopic rules underlying the kinetic model
We now summarise the microscopic rules which underpin the system of integro-diﬀerential equa-
tions governing the evolution of the distribution functions fJ(x, t), J ∈{N, D, M, C}, that is, the
kinetic model (9) presented in Section 2.2.
Microscopic rules underlying the dynamics of normal and damaged cells.
Building
upon [8], we assume normal cells to become damaged as a result of interactions with cytotoxic T
lymphocytes, while interactions between damaged cells and macrophages result in damaged cells
being cleared out and normal cells being replenished through muscle regeneration. Therefore,
denoting the values of the densities of normal and damaged cells by xN ∈R+ and xD ∈R+,
respectively, and the values of the densities of macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes by
xM ∈R+ and xC ∈R+, respectively, we deﬁne the value of the density of normal cells upon
interactions between normal cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, x′
N ∈R+, and the value of the
density of damaged cells upon interactions between damaged cells and macrophages, x′
D ∈R+, as
x′
N = xN −βNΦN(xC)xN + ηN(xC)xN,
x′
D = xD −βDΦD(xM)xD + ηD(xM)xD.
(4)

In the deﬁnitions (4), the terms βNΦN(xC)xN and ηN(xC)xN model, respectively, deterministic
and random variations in the value of the density of normal cells due to interactions with cytotoxic
T lymphocytes. Similarly, the terms βDΦD(xM)xD and ηD(xM)xD model deterministic and ran-
dom variations in the value of the density of damaged cells due to interactions with macrophages.
Here ΦN(xC) and ΦD(xM) are non-negative saturating functions such that ΦN(0) = ΦD(0) = 0.
To retain simplicity and maintain generality, throughout the paper we set
ΦN(x) = ΦD(x) =
x
1 + x,
x ∈R+.
(5)
The parameter βN > 0 thus provides a possible measure of the maximum relative change in
normal cell density due to interactions with T lymphocytes, while the parameter βD > 0 provides
a possible measure of the maximum relative change in damaged cell density due to interactions
with macrophages. Moreover, ηN and ηC are independent random variables such that, denoting
the expectation of a random variable with respect to the corresponding probability density function
by ⟨·⟩,
⟨ηN⟩= ⟨ηD⟩= 0,

η2
N

= σ2
NΦN(xC),

η2
D

= σ2
DΦD(xM).
Hence, the parameters σN and σD are linked to the standard deviations of the zero-mean random
variables that model ﬂuctuations in the densities of normal and damaged cells.
Coherently with the microscopic rules deﬁned via (4), we deﬁne the value of the density of
normal cells upon interactions between damaged cells and macrophages, x′′
N ∈R+, and the value of
the density of damaged cells upon interactions between normal cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes,
x′′
D ∈R+, as
x′′
N = xN + βDΦD(xM)xD,
x′′
D = xD + βNΦN(xC)xN.
(6)
Note that the deﬁnitions (4) and (6) complemented with the deﬁnitions (5) are such that if
xN, xD, xM, xC ≥0 then both x′
N, x′
D ≥0 and x′′
N, x′′
D ≥0 for any βN, βD > 0.
Microscopic rules underlying the dynamics of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and mac-
rophages.
We let the densities of macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, xM ∈R+ and
xC ∈R+, undergo natural decay at constant rates βM > 0 and βC > 0, respectively, along with
small random ﬂuctuations due to homeostatic regulation mechanisms. Moreover, building again
upon [8], we let the density of macrophages increase at a rate proportional to the density of dam-
aged cells, xD ∈R+, with a constant of proportionality γM > 0, while the density of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes increases at a rate proportional to the the density of macrophages with a constant of
proportionality γC > 0. Hence, we deﬁne the value of the density of macrophages (resp. cytotoxic
T lymphocytes) upon natural decay with small random ﬂuctuations, x′
M ∈R+ (resp. x′
C ∈R+),
and the value of the density of macrophages (resp. cytotoxic T lymphocytes) upon growth caused
by the presence of damaged cells (resp. macrophages), x′′
M (resp. x′′
C), as
x′
M = xM −βMxM + ηMxM,
x′′
M = xM + γMxD,
(7)
and
x′
C = xC −βCxC + ηCxC,
x′′
C = xC + γCxM.
(8)
Here ηM and ηC are independent random variables such that
⟨ηM⟩= ⟨ηC⟩= 0,

η2
M

= σ2
M,

η2
C

= σ2
C.
Therefore, the parameters σM and σC are the standard deviations of the zero-mean random
variables that model ﬂuctuations in the densities of macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
Note again that the deﬁnitions (7) and (8) are such that if xN, xD, xM, xC ≥0 then both
x′
M, x′
C ≥0 and x′′
M, x′′
C ≥0 for any βM, βC > 0.

2.2
The kinetic model
The evolution of the distribution functions fJ(x, t), J ∈{N, D, C, M}, is governed by the kinetic
model deﬁned by the following system of integro-diﬀerential equations
∂
∂tfN = QN(fN, fC) + FβD(fN, fD, fM),
∂
∂tfD = QD(fD, fM) + FβN (fD, fN, fC),
∂
∂tfM = L(fM) + RγM (fM, fD),
∂
∂tfC = L(fC) + RγC(fC, fM),

where the microscopic rules formulated in Section 2.1 are mirrored into the deﬁnitions of the
operators Q, F, L, and R, as it is common in kinetic theory – see e.g. [25] and references therein.

Note that, as expected, when subject to initial conditions with non-negative components of
unit mass, i.e. initial conditions such that
Z
R+
fJ(x, 0)dx = 1,
J ∈{N, D, M, C},
(11)
the components of the solution to the kinetic model (9) are also non-negative and with unit mass
for all t > 0, that is, conditions (1) hold.
2.2.1
Evolution of key observable macroscopic quantities for the kinetic model
To investigate the dynamics of the cell populations in the cohort of patients under consideration
at the level of observable macroscopic quantities, such as the mean, mJ(t), deﬁned via (2) (i.e. the
expected value of the density of cells in population J at time t) and the variance, VJ(t), deﬁned
via (3), it is convenient to rewrite the kinetic model (9) in the following weak form

where ϕJ(x), J ∈{N, D, M, C}, are smooth test functions and the interaction kernel κ is deﬁned
via (10).
Evolution equations for mJ(t), J ∈{N, D, M, C}.
Choosing ϕJ(x) = x in the weak form (12)
of the kinetic model (9), we obtain the following system of diﬀerential equations for the means
d
dtmN(t) = −βNmN(t)mC(t) + βDmM(t)mD(t),
d
dtmD(t) = −βDmD(t)mM(t) + βNmN(t)mC(t),
d
dtmM(t) = −βMmM(t) + γMmD(t),
d
dtmC(t) = −βCmC(t) + γCmM(t).
(13)
Note that the system (13) is consistent with the compartmental model considered in [8] within
the framework of the simplifying assumptions that underlie the kinetic model considered here.

From the system (13) we see that when the kinetic model (9) is subject to non-negative initial
conditions that, in addition to (11), satisfy
0 < mJ(0) =
Z
R+
xfJ(x, 0)dx < ∞,
J ∈{N, D, M, C},
(14)
then
0 < mJ(t) =
Z
R+
xfJ(x, 0)dx < ∞
∀t > 0,
J ∈{N, D, M, C}.
(15)
From the system (13) we also see that
mN(t) + mD(t) = mN(0) + mD(0)
∀t > 0,
and, therefore, under an initial condition that satisﬁes the additional condition
mN(0) + mD(0) = m0 > 0
(16)
we have
mN(t) + mD(t) = m0
∀t ≥0.
(17)
Finally, under assumptions (14) and (16) on the initial condition, as t →∞the solution of the
system (13) converges to the equilibrium of components

Note that, in contrast to the system (13), the system (19) is not closed as it still requires the
knowledge of the distribution functions fJ(x, t), J ∈{N, D, M, C}. This hinders obtaining a self-
consistent representation of the dynamics of the cell populations in the patient cohort in terms
of observable macroscopic quantities. To circumvent this diﬃculty, in the next section we will
derive a mean-ﬁeld counterpart of the kinetic model (9) – cf. the mean-ﬁeld model (23)-(26) – for
which the corresponding system of diﬀerential equations for the means is the same as (13), while
the system of diﬀerential equations for the variances is closed. In addition, for the mean-ﬁeld
model one can also obtain a detailed characterisation of the long-term limits of the distribution
functions, and not only of the corresponding means and variances, as demonstrated in Section 3,
which supports a more detailed statistical representation of the cell populations in the patient
cohort.

2.3
Corresponding mean-ﬁeld model
Building upon the method employed, for instance, in [4, 9, 15], we introduce a small scaling
parameter 0 < ǫ ≪1 and scale the time variable as
t →t/ǫ
(20)
and the model parameters as
βJ →ǫβJ and σ2
J →ǫσ2
J for J ∈{N, D, M, C},
γC →ǫγC,
γM →ǫγM.
(21)
Under this parameter scaling, the dynamics governed by the microscopic rules deﬁned via (4), (6),
(7), and (8) become quasi-invariant, which allows us to resort to the following Taylor expansions
ϕJ(x′) −ϕJ(x) ≈(x′ −x)ϕ′
J(x) + 1
2(x′ −x)2ϕ′′
J(x) + 1
6(x′ −x)3ϕ′′′
J (¯x),
ϕJ(x′′) −ϕJ(x) ≈ϕ′

for J ∈{N, D, M, C}, where
¯x ∈(min{x, x′}, max{x, x′}),
˜x ∈(min{x, x′′}, max{x, x′′}).
Then, introducing the scaled distribution functions
f ǫ
J(x, t) = fJ(x, t/ǫ),
J ∈{N, D, M, C},
substituting the time scaling (20) along with the above Taylor expansions into the weak form (12)
of the integro-diﬀerential equation for the distribution function fN(x, t), we formally obtain the
following weak form of the integro-diﬀerential equation for the scaled distribution function f ǫ

the means mǫ
J(t) = mJ(x, t/ǫ), J ∈{N, D, M, C}, deﬁned via (2) coincide with the components
of the solution to the system (13) (i.e. if mǫ
J(0) = mJ(0) then mǫ
J(t) = mJ(t) for all t > 0), which
are bounded (cf. (15)). Hence, we have that |Rǫ
N|/ǫ →0 for ǫ →0+. As a result, denoting by
fN(x, t) the weak limit of f ǫ
N(x, t) as ǫ →0+, from (22) we formally obtain, in the asymptotic
regime ǫ →0+, the following weak formulation of the governing equation for fN(x, t)

The system (23), (25), complemented with the deﬁnitions (2), posed on R+ and subject to the
boundary conditions (24), (26) is a mean-ﬁeld limit of the kinetic model (9).
Note that, as it is for the kinetic model (9), when subject to initial conditions with non-negative
components of unit mass, the components of the solution to the mean-ﬁeld model (23)-(26) are
also non-negative with unit mass for all t > 0 – i.e. conditions (1) are met.
2.3.1
Evolution of key observable macroscopic quantities for the mean-ﬁeld model
Through direct calculations, one can easily verify that: as expected, the evolution of the means,
mJ(t), deﬁned via (2), for the mean-ﬁeld model (23)-(26) is governed by the system (13) as it is
for the kinetic model (9); on the other hand, the evolution of the variances, VJ(t), deﬁned via (3)
is governed by the following system which, in contrast to the system (19) obtained for the kinetic
model (9), is a closed system:

Long-time asymptotics for the mean-ﬁeld model
In this section, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-ﬁeld model (23)-(26). In more detail,
we ﬁrst characterise the components of the quasi-equilibrium solution and show that they converge
to equilibrium as t →∞(see Section 3.1). Then we prove the convergence, with respect to an
appropriate norm, of the solution to the quasi-equilibrium solution as t →∞, which implies, in the
light of the convergence to equilibrium of the quasi-equilibrium solution as t →∞, the long-time
convergence of the solution of the mean-ﬁeld model to equilibrium (see Section 3.2).
3.1
Characterisation of the quasi-equilibrium distribution
The components of the quasi-equilibrium distribution, f q
J(x, t) for J ∈{N, D, M, C}, of the mean-
ﬁeld model (23)-(26) are the components of the solution to the following system of diﬀerential
equations

Solving the system of diﬀerential equations (31) subject to the boundary conditions (24)
and (26), we ﬁnd that the non-negative components, with unit mass, of the quasi-equilibrium
distribution are probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions with constant shape
parameters, νJ, and time-dependent scale parameters, ωJ(t). Speciﬁcally, for the N and D com-

Since the shape parameters deﬁned via (33) and (35) are such that νJ > 1 for all J ∈{N, D, M, C},
through the formula for the mean of the inverse Gamma distribution we ﬁnd

N(t) = ωN(t)

Considering non-negative initial data that satisfy conditions (14) along with condition (16),
which gives the constraint corresponding to (17), the above expressions for ωJ(t), J ∈{N, D, M, C},
along with the bounds (15) on mJ(t), J ∈{N, D, M, C}, imply that there exists some constants
0 < cJ < CJ < ∞such that
cJ ≤ωJ(t) ≤CJ
∀t ≥0,
J ∈{N, D, M, C},
(36)
while the above expressions for mq
J(t) imply that
mq
J(t) →m∞
J
as t →∞,
J ∈{N, D, M, C},
(37)
with m∞
J given by (18). Furthermore, the expressions of ωJ(t), J ∈{N, D, M, C}, ensure that
there exist some constants 0 ≤Cp
J < ∞such that, denoting the derivative of ωJ(t) by ω′
J(t),
ω′
J(t) ≤Cp
J,
∀t ≥0,
J ∈{N, D, M, C},
(38)
since mC(t) > 0 and mM(t) > 0 for all t ≥0 (cf. (15)).
Moreover, under the additional assumptions (29) on the model parameters, which ensure that
the shape parameters deﬁned via (33) and (35) are also such that νJ > 2 for all J ∈{N, D, M, C},
the variances of the inverse Gamma quasi-equilibrium distributions are given by

J ∈{N, D, M, C},

yields

3.2
Long-time convergence to the equilibrium distribution
The convergence of the components, fJ(x, t) for J ∈{N, D, M, C}, of the solution of the mean-
ﬁeld model (23)-(26) to the corresponding quasi-equilibrium distribution functions, f q
J(x, t) for
J ∈{N, D, M, C}, deﬁned via (32) and (34), can be obtained in the ˙H−p norm1 deﬁned as
∥f∥2
˙H−p =
Z
R
|ξ|−2p| ˆf(ξ)|2dξ,
p > 1
2,
(43)
where ˆf is the Fourier transform of the probability density function f(x), that is, ˆf(ξ) =
R
R+ f(x)e−iξxdx.
This is shown by Theorem 3.1.
Theorem 3.1. Let fJ(0, x), J ∈{N, D, M, C}, be probability density functions on R+ such that
conditions (11), (14), (16), and (28) hold and such that ∥fJ(0, x)−f ∞
J (x)∥˙H−p < ∞for 1
2 < p < 1,
with f ∞
J (x) given by (41). Then, the solution to the mean-ﬁeld model (23)-(26) is such that
X
J∈{N,D,M,C}
∥fJ −f ∞
J ∥˙H−p →0
as t →∞,
1
2 < p < 1.
Proof.
Step 1: fN →f q
N in ˙H−p, with 1
2 < p < 1, as t →∞. Since the right-hand side of the Fokker-
Planck equation (23) for fN(x, t) vanishes when fN = f q
N, with f q
N being the quasi-equilibrium
distribution given by (32), we have

of such metrics.

Since both fN and f q
N are probability density functions on R+ we have that ˆfN(0, t) = c
f q
N(0, t) = 1.
Thus, expanding in Taylor series about ξ = 0 we obtain

Numerical tests
We now illustrate, by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations, the theoretical results
obtained in the previous sections. In more detail, in Section 4.2 we numerically show that, under
the time scaling (20) and the parameter scaling (21), when the scaling parameter ǫ is suﬃciently
small, the solution of the kinetic model (9) converges to the solution of the mean-ﬁeld model (23)-
(26). Then, in Section 4.3 we numerically show that the components of the solution of the mean-
ﬁeld model converge, in the norm deﬁned via (43), to the equilibrium distributions deﬁned via (41)
as t →∞. A summary of the set-up of numerical simulations is provided in Section 4.1.

Set-up of numerical simulations
Numerical simulations of the kinetic model are carried out through direct Monte Carlo (DSMC)
methods [24, 25], employing a system of N = 105 particles. Distribution functions are reconstruc-
ted through standard histograms and the corresponding moments are estimated through classical
Monte Carlo estimators from the particles’ system. Moreover, the system of Fokker-Planck equa-
tions of the mean-ﬁeld model is solved numerically through structure-preserving methods [26].
These methods are capable of reproducing long-time statistical properties of exact steady-state
solutions with arbitrary accuracy, while ensuring preservation of positivity of the solution along
with consistent entropy dissipation. For the structure preserving scheme, we employ a uniform
grid over the interval [0, L] with L = 12, which is discretised with Nx = 801 grid points. We use
a 6th order discretization in space, with step ∆x, and a 2nd order semi-implicit discretization in
time with step ∆t = 0.5∆x.
The parameter values used to carry out numerical simulations are provided in Table 1. Such
parameter values were chosen with exploratory aim (i.e. to observe the eﬀects of all the mechanisms
incorporated into the model over a reasonable computational time scale) and they are to be
intended as being dimensionless. Furthermore, we deﬁne the initial cell distribution functions as
the following uniform distributions

with mN(0) = 9, mD(0) = 1, mM(0) = 0.6, mC(0) = 0.6. The distributions deﬁned via (52) are
such that VJ(0) = 0.1 for all J ∈{N, D, M, C}. The initial distributions of particles for Monte
Carlo simulations are sampled from (52).
4.2
Consistency between the kinetic model and its mean-ﬁeld limit
The plots in Figures 2 and 3 display the evolution of the means, mJ(t) deﬁned via (2), and the
variances, VJ(t) deﬁned via (3), of the distribution functions, fJ(x, t) with J ∈{N, D, M, C}, of
the kinetic model, under the time scaling (20) and the parameter scaling (21), for diﬀerent values
of the scaling parameter ǫ, i.e. ǫ ∈{10−3, 10−2, 10−1, 5 × 10−1}, as well as the means and the
variances of the distribution functions of the corresponding mean-ﬁeld model. As expected, based
on the systems of diﬀerential equations for the means and the variances of the kinetic model and
the corresponding systems for the mean-ﬁeld model derived in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, changing
the value of ǫ does not lead to appreciable changes in the dynamics of the means, while it does lead
to more signiﬁcant changes in the dynamics of the variances. Moreover, for ǫ suﬃciently small,
there is an excellent quantitative agreement between the dynamics not only of the means but also

they converge to the equilibrium distributions, f ∞

Conclusions and perspectives
In this paper, we have presented a novel kinetic model for MDs. The model comprises a system
of integro-diﬀerential equations for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the
densities of muscle ﬁbers and immune cells implicated in muscle inﬂammation, degeneration, and
regeneration, which underpin disease development. Through an appropriate scaling procedure, we
have formally derived the corresponding mean-ﬁeld and macroscopic limits, thereby establishing
a hierarchy of models that consistently describe the dynamics of muscle and immune cells playing
a key role in the development of MDs across scales.
Exploiting its analytical tractability, we have studied the long-time behaviour of the mean-ﬁeld
model. The analytical results obtained, which have been illustrated through numerical simula-
tions, provide a full characterisation of the equilibrium cell distribution functions and establish
convergence to equilibrium. These results oﬀer a detailed mathematical depiction of how diﬀerent
parameters underlying cell dynamics shape the statistical distributions of muscle and immune cells
over the patient cohort. As such, they also exemplify how, although the focus of this paper has
been on mathematical aspects, the proposed modeling approach has the potential to serve as a
quantitative tool to gain new insights into the role that diﬀerent cellular processes underlying the
interaction dynamics between muscle and immune cells may play in the progression of MDs.
The present work provides a basis for future extensions, including modeling the action of
therapeutic interventions. In this regard, an avenue for future research could be to investigate the
eﬀect of therapeutic approaches that keep under control the growth of the density of cytotoxic
T lymphocytes induced by macrophages, in the vein of the recent experimental results on DMD
presented in [33]. This could be done, for instance, by modifying the deﬁnition (8) of x′′
C as follows
x′′
C = xC + γCxM −νxC,
where the parameter ν ≥0 would be linked to the eﬃcacy of therapy. In the mean-ﬁeld limit,
this would then result in the Fokker-Planck equation (25) for fC being replaced by the following
equation for ¯fC, i.e. the controlled density of cytotoxic T lymphocytes,
∂
∂t
¯fC(x, t) = σ2
C
2
∂2
∂x2 (x2 ¯fC(x, t) + ∂
∂x

[(βC + ν) x −γC ¯mM] ¯fC(x, t)
	
.
The mean density of cytotoxic T lymphocytes for ν > 0, i.e. the controlled mean ¯mC, would then
satisfy the following diﬀerential equation
d
dt ¯mC = −(βC + ν) ¯mC + γC ¯mM,
and the equilibrium value of the mean density of normal cells, i.e. the controlled mean ¯m∞
N , and
the corresponding variance, ¯V ∞
N , would thus be
¯m∞
N =
βD(βC + ν)m0
βD(βC + ν) + βNγC
,
¯V ∞
N =
σ2
N
2βN −σ2
N
( ¯m∞
N )2.
Recalling the expression of the equilibrium value of the mean density of normal cells for ν = 0,
i.e. the mean m∞
N deﬁned via (18), and the corresponding variance, V ∞
N deﬁned via (30), one sees
that
¯m∞
N > m∞
N ,
¯V ∞
N > V ∞
N .
Hence, compared to the case without treatment, the therapy would have the beneﬁcial eﬀect of
allowing for a larger number of normal cells to be preserved, but it would also have the detrimental
eﬀect of increasing the corresponding variance. This would imply a higher level of intra-patient
heterogeneity, which might undermine therapeutic eﬃcacy by making the design of targeted thera-
peutic strategies more challenging. This suggests the need for combination therapy to thwart such
a detrimental eﬀect, which points the way toward novel compelling research directions for the
mathematical modeling of MDs.
