Abstract
We investigate1 the constraints and phenomenology of a three Higgs doublet
model (3HDM) with a Z2 × Z2 symmetry, featuring two inert scalar doublets that
give rise to a two-component dark matter (DM) scenario. We analyze the model’s
vacuum structure, exploring the competition between different symmetry-breaking
minima, and subject it to comprehensive theoretical and current experimental con-
straints.
Our analysis reveals previously unexplored regions of parameter space
with viable dark matter candidates. Notably, we identify scenarios where both DM
particles contribute comparably to the observed relic density, offering distinctive
experimental signatures that could guide future searches.

Introduction
N-Higgs Doublet Models (NHDM) offer simple yet effective extensions of the Standard
Model (SM) with a variety of new features. These models allow for the possibility of
CP violation, provide viable candidates for Dark Matter (DM), and possess large regions
of parameter space that are experimentally accessible, particularly at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC).
A common variant is the 2HDM, which introduces besides the SM a new scalar doublet
with a Z2 symmetry. This symmetry leaves the SM fields unchanged and leads to the
Inert Doublet Model (IDM) scenario. In this setup, the DM particle states were initially
in thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma before decoupling via the freeze-out
mechanism. The relic abundance of DM, given by ΩDMh2 ≈0.12 (Planck, 2021)[2], is
determined through the thermally averaged cross-section ⟨σv⟩. The viable DM mass range

in this model typically lies between Mh/2 ≲MDM ≲Mh, or alternatively, 500 GeV ≲
MDM.
In a more complex extension, the Two Inert 3HDM introduces a Z2 × Z2 symmetry,
which again does not alter the SM fields but enforces additional constraints. This sym-
metry forbids the decay of one sector to the other, further enhancing the stability of the
DM candidate and providing new avenues for study in both direct and indirect detection
experiments.
We discuss in detail all possible vacua, and the conditions guaranteeing that the
double inert vacuum is indeed the global minimum.
We also discuss all the collider,
astrophysical and cosmological constraints which we will use in our simulations.
We
show that it is possible to have a DM candidate mass at any value [1
2mh, 1000GeV],
while it is possible that both candidates contribute equally to the relic density for either
1
2mh < mH1 < 80 GeV or mH1 ⪆500 GeV.

Model Consistency
3.1
BFB
The first thing we have to check is if the potential is bounded from below(BFB). To this
end, and also to look at the possible minima we use the parameterization of Ref.[4],
ϕ1 = √r1

sin α1
cos α1 eiβ1

,
ϕ2 = √r2eiγ

sin α2
cos α2 eiβ2

,
ϕ3 = √r3
0


.
(2)
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the Z2 ×Z2 3HDM to be bounded from below
are only known along neutral directions [5], α1 = α2 = 0. Only sufficient when considering
charge breaking directions[4]. We have derived[3] a general method of obtaining sufficient
conditions for 3HDM’s.
To obtain these we start by writing the quartic part of the
potential as
V4 = VN + VCB + VZ2×Z2,
(3)
where
VN =λ1(ϕ†
1ϕ1)2 + λ2(ϕ†
2ϕ2)2 + λ3(ϕ†
3ϕ3)2 + (λ4 + λ7)(ϕ†
1ϕ1)(ϕ†
2ϕ2)
+ (λ5 + λ8)(ϕ†
1ϕ1)(ϕ†
3ϕ3) + (λ6 + λ9)(ϕ†
2ϕ2)(ϕ†
3ϕ3) ,
(4)
VCB = −λ7z12 −λ8z13 −λ9z23 ,
(5)
VZ2×Z2 =

Now the idea is to find a potential lower than the original one and for which it is simple
to find the BFB conditions. These will be sufficient but not necessary conditions.

(15)
The potential is BFB if the matrix A is copositive. The copositivity conditions for a 3×3
matrix can be found in Ref.[6].
3.2
Vacua
We are interested in a 2-Inert minimum, (0, 0, v). We need to identify the parameter
space with the 2-Inert configuration as the global minimum, having for all other minima,
V2Inert < VX .
We now list all the possible minima, either among the neutral directions or along the
charge breaking ones.
3.2.1
Possible Vacua: The Neutral case
We start with the vacua along the neutral directions. The most general neutral vacuum
configuration may be parameterized as,
⟨ϕ1⟩=

0
v1eiξ1

,
⟨ϕ2⟩=

0
v2eiξ2

,
⟨ϕ3⟩=
 0
v3

.
(16)
This was studied in Ref.[7]. We use their notation for the naming of the different vacua,
as shown in Tab. 1.
We have confirmed their vacua but we have found a new one that we called F0DM0’.

3.2.2
Possible Vacua: The Charged case
Now we turn to the charge breaking vacua. We continue to follow the notation of Ref.[7].
The list of all possible charge breaking vacua are shown in Tab. 2. As before, we have
identified an extra possibility; the last entry in the table. To confirm our results we have
also numerically minimized the potential with Minuit[8] for random initial conditions to
make sure all possibilities were verified.
3.2.3
Global minima procedure:
To find the correct global minimum we therefore follow the steps,
• Identify all possible minima.
• Apply BFB and conditions for 2-Inert to be global minima.
• Numerically minimize the potential with Minuit for random initial conditions.
• Confirm none of the points ever give a lower vacuum.
• In particular we verified that the sufficient BFB were correct has we did not find
any point unbounded from below.
3.2.4
Other Constraints
The remaining restrictions to consider include,
• The S matrix must satisfy perturbative unitarity (use the results from[9] for all the
3HDMs).
• Agreement with the S, T and U electroweak precision parameters using the formulas
from[10].
• For h125, we use µh
if from ATLAS[11] .
• For the other scalars we use HiggsTools 1.1.3 [12] that uses the experimental cross
section limits from the LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC (at 95% C.L).
• Upper limit on the Higgs total decay width is set by [13] at Γtot ≤9.1 MeV .

3.2.5
Constraints from Dark Matter
Finally we have to comply with the constraints coming from DM. These are,
• The total relic density[2] is given by the sum of the contributions from the DM
candidates,
ΩTh2 = ΩH1h2 + ΩH2h2 = 0.1200 ± 0.0012.
(17)
• The invisible Higgs branching ratio[14], Br(h →invisible) < 0.11.
• From direct detection - Spin-independent (SI) scattering cross section from LZ[15]
with future DARWIN/XLZD and PandaX-xT. Rescale the calculated σ by the
relative relic density.
• From indirect detection - detect gamma rays, cosmic rays or neutrinos from DM
annihilation. For GeV scale, use Fermi-LAT[16] γ′s in dwarf galaxies, antiproton
from flux AMS[17] and γ′s in Galactic Center from H.E.S.S.[18].

The Scan
To perform the scan it proves useful to define[7],
Λ1 = 1
2 (λ4 + λ7 + 2λ′′
10) , Λ2 = 1
2 (λ6 + λ9 + 2λ′′
12) , Λ3 = 1
2 (λ5 + λ8 + 2λ′′
11) .
(18)
The parameter space has 15 parameters that we choose as follows:
v2, m2
H1, m2
H2, m2
H3 = m2
SM, m2
A1, m2
A2, m2
H±
1 , m2
H±
2 , Λ1, Λ2, Λ3, λ1, λ2, λ4, λ7.

We built a FORTRAN program for the model to calculate all the quantities for a randomly
generated set of parameters and test all the constraints. We then generate the FeynRules
and CalcHEP model files in order to implement the model in micrOMEGAs 6.0.5. The
couplings were derived with the help of FeynMaster[19, 20, 21].

Results
5.1
Direct detection
In this section we present the results coming from applying all the constraints. First we
focus in direct detection. The results are shown in Fig. 2.
Figure 2: Direct detection constraints on H1 (H2) on the left (right) figure. See text for
details.
The points pass all previous constraints, including collider and we take mH2 > mH1
always. The presence of orange/pink points above LZ line shows that this is a relevant
6


exclusion method. For low mH1 it is possible that direct detection probes H1 without
affecting H2. We also note that final exposures of DARWIN may reach the high mass
section of the neutrino floor. Then other probes must be used.
5.2
Indirect detection
Now we turn to the indirect constraints. Fig. 3-left shows the total ⟨σv⟩. The figure
Figure 3: The colours of the points have the same meaning as in Fig. 2. The left figure
shows the total ⟨σv⟩as a function of mH1. The right figure shows the dominant contribu-
tion to ⟨σv⟩as a function of the mass of the DM candidate, mDM, which corresponds to
the ⟨σv⟩plotted on the vertical axis. The lines coming from Fermi-LAT [16] and H.E.S.S.
[18] assume a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM density profile and the AMS-02 [17] lines
correspond to the conservative approach derived in Ref. [22], with the colour codes also
shown in the figure.
shows the total ⟨σv⟩as a function of mH1. candidate. We assume a Navarro-Frenk-
White (NFW) DM density profile. We calculate the contributing channels and take the
upper limit from the reconstruction of the experimental signal for the dominant channel:
above the W threshold, the annihilation proceeds mostly into WW; it occurs into b¯b
otherwise. Importantly we have found that the Planck constraints (almost) guarantee
indirect detection to not have effect.
5.3
Relic density
The results for the relic density are shown in Fig. 4. All points shown satisfy all con-
straints, including direct and indirect detection, and have the correct total relic density.
If H1 were the only DM component, combining relic density and direct detection con-

straints would lead to the same mass regions as in the IDM. It is possible to have a
7


DM candidate mass at any value [1
2mh, 1000GeV ] . In the intermediate mass range, by
requiring that it is H2 which is mostly responsible for the relic density. Equal abundance
is possible for either 1
2mh < mH1 < 80GeV or mH1 ⪆500GeV .

Conclusions
In view of recent interest in multi-component DM models, we focus our attention on
a Z2 × Z2 symmetric 3HDM with a double inert vacuum. We begin by revisiting the
potential solutions to the stationarity equations, ensuring that our solution represents
the absolute minimum. In the process, we identify two new significant minima, which we
designate as F0DM0’ and F0CB.
To guarantee that we account for all global minima, we must compare not only with
the previously identified solutions F0DM1, F0DM2, and F0DM0, but also with these new
minima: F0DM0’ and F0CB.
We have derived explicit expressions for all these cases, which makes direct compar-
ison straightforward. Additionally, we ensure consistency with key physical constraints,
including unitarity, Bounded-From-Below (BFB) conditions, and compatibility with the
oblique parameters S, T and U.
Following this step, we apply all current collider constraints to the parameter space of
our model, including limits on the 125 GeV couplings, searches for additional scalars, and
flavor observables. Next, we focus on the implications of relic density, direct detection
(DD), and indirect detection (ID) of dark matter (DM).
Through an extensive scan of the parameter space, we observe that the simplistic
conclusions drawn from narrow regions of the parameter space no longer hold. Instead,
a much broader and more diverse range of possibilities emerges. Notably, we find regions
where two distinct DM candidates contribute equally to the relic density. In the Z2 × Z2
model, the entire mass spectrum for a given component can be populated, including
intermediate mass ranges where one component dominates the relic density calculation
while the other plays a secondary role.
Additionally, we take into account the future sensitivity of direct detection experi-
ments, which are expected to probe the high-mass section of the neutrino ”fog” without
ruling out the model. This highlights the need for complementary probes to fully test
the viability of the model.
