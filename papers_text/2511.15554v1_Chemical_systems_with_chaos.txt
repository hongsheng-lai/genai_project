Chemical systems with chaos
Tomislav Plesa 1
Abstract: Three-dimensional polynomial dynamical systems (DSs) can display chaos with various
properties already in the quadratic case with only one or two quadratic monomials. In particular,
one-wing chaos is reported in quadratic DSs with only one quadratic monomial, while two-wing and
hidden chaos in quadratic DSs with only two quadratic monomials. However, none of the reported
DSs can be realized with chemical reactions. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we investigate chaos
in chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a subset of polynomial DSs that can model the dynamics
of mass-action chemical reaction networks.
To this end, we develop a fundamental theory for
mapping polynomial DSs into CDSs of the same dimension and with a reduced number of non-
linear terms. Applying this theory, we show that, under suitable robustness assumptions, quadratic
CDSs, and cubic CDSs with only one cubic, can display a rich set of chaotic solutions already in
three dimensions. Furthermore, we construct some relatively simple three-dimensional examples,
including a quadratic CDS with one-wing chaos and three quadratics, a cubic CDS with two-wing
chaos and one cubic, and a quadratic CDS with hidden chaos and five quadratics.

Introduction
Systems of N first-order autonomous ordinary-differential equations with polynomials of at most
degree n on the right-hand sides, called N-dimensional n-degree polynomial dynamical systems
(DSs), can display a rich set of solutions whose complexity increases with N and n. In particular,
by the Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem [1, 2], when N ≤2, every bounded solution of this class of
DSs in the long run converges to an equilibrium (time-independent solution), a solution connecting
equilibria, or a cycle (time-periodic solution). On the other hand, if N ≥3 and n ≥2, then the
dynamics can become vastly more complicated: polynomial DSs can then display solutions that are
bounded and unstable, and that do not converge to equilibria, solutions connecting equilibria or
cycles [1, 2]. Under further suitable properties, a set containing such solutions is called a chaotic set;
if, furthermore, this set attracts all nearby solutions, then it is called a chaotic attractor [1, 2, 3].
Containing unstable solutions, nearby solutions in a chaotic set may diverge from each other fast;
consequently, an infeasible precision in the initial conditions may be needed to accurately compute
the solutions beyond some time, inspiring the name chaos.
A number of polynomial DSs with N = 3 and n = 2 are reported that, despite structural
simplicity, display chaos with various properties [4]. Examples include three-dimensional quadratic
DSs with only 1 quadratic monomial, such as the R¨ossler system [5] and Sprott systems F–S [6],
and with only 2 quadratic monomials, such as the Lorenz system [7] and Sprott systems A–E [6].
Topologically, all of these systems have chaotic attractors with one wing, except the Lorenz and
Sprott systems B–C which have chaotic attractors with two wings. The two-quadratic-terms DSs
can also have a chaotic attractor coexisting with a unique and stable equilibrium [8]; such attractors
are said to be hidden, as they cannot be detected from the initial conditions close to the equilibrium.
With some exceptions, such as the Lorenz system, chaos is numerically demonstrated, but not
proved to exist, in these examples. In particular, proving existence of chaos is in general difficult;
for example, it took more than three decades to prove chaoticity of the Lorenz system [9].

In this paper, we focus on a special subset of polynomial DSs that can model the time-evolution
of the (non-negative) concentrations of chemical species, reacting under mass-action kinetics, called
chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) [10]; in addition to chemistry, CDSs are also used to model
a range of biological phenomena [11, 12].
For example, dx/dt = (1 −x) is a one-dimensional
linear CDS which models the time-evolution of the concentration x = x(t) of chemical species X
reacting according to the production reaction ∅→X and the degradation reaction X →∅, where
∅denotes some species not explicitly modelled. In contrast, polynomial DS dx/dt = −1 is not
chemical, because the monomial −1 drives x(t) to negative values, which are chemically infeasible.
CDSs with chaos in the positive orthant are reported in the literature. However, compared to
the general polynomial DSs, the reported chaotic CDSs are structurally more complicated - they
have a higher dimension N, higher polynomial degree n, or a larger number of non-linear terms.
In particular, chaos is proven to exist in a class of quadratic CDSs that are five-dimensional [13],
and in another class of quadratic CDSs with sufficiently high dimension [14], in three-dimensional
quartic CDSs [15] and, as proven more recently, in three-dimensional cubic CDSs with exactly 2
cubics [10][Theorem 5.2]. Simpler systems are reported with more numerically-established chaos. In
particular, the minimal Willamowski–R¨ossler system [16, 17] is a three-dimensional quadratic CDS
with exactly 6 quadratic monomials, put forward as having one-wing chaos; a computer-assisted
proof of some chaotic properties is presented in [18]. Another three-dimensional quadratic CDS
with exactly 6 quadratics is constructed in [10][Theorem E.1]; its chaoticity is guaranteed assuming
that Sprott system P [6][Table 1], from which it is derived, has suitably robust chaos. To the best
of the author’s knowledge, no three-dimensional quadratic CDS with (one-wing) chaos and 5 or less
quadratics, or cubic CDS with two-wing chaos and less than 2 cubics, are reported at the time of
writing this paper. Furthermore, no three-dimensional quadratic or cubic CDSs with hidden chaos
and a unique and stable equilibrium are reported; see also [19].
(a) One-wing chaos (39)
(b) Two-wing chaos (45)
(c) Hidden chaos (51)
Figure 1: Three-dimensional CDSs with chaos. Panels (a)–(c) display solutions of the quadratic
CDS (39) with exactly 3 quadratic monomials, cubic CDS (45) with exactly 1 cubic monomial,
and the quadratic CDS (51) with exactly 5 quadratic monomials, respectively. The parameters and
initial conditions are chosen as in Figures 3–5, respectively.
In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing and applying some fundamental theory about
mapping non-chemical into chemical DSs. In particular, the so-called quasi-chemical maps (QCMs)
are introduced in [10], that can map polynomial DSs into CDSs purely by smoothly perturbing
its right-hand side and translating the dependent variables, thereby preserving both the dimension
and robust structures. In this paper, we construct some novel QCMs that are refined to introduce
a lower number of non-linear terms, thus being suitable for designing structurally simpler CDSs.
We then apply this theory to prove some results about the capacity of CDSs to have chaos. In
2


particular, we prove that every quadratic DS with only 1 quadratic monomial, and with suitably
robust chaos, can be mapped to a quadratic CDS of the same dimension and with chaos preserved.
Similarly, we show that every quadratic DS with only 2 quadratic monomials can be mapped
to a cubic CDS with only 1 cubic monomial, and that such CDSs can display chaos in three
dimensions. Furthermore, we construct some three-dimensional examples which appear to be the
simplest reported so far when it comes to the number of the highest-degree monomials: a quadratic
CDS with a one-wing chaotic attractor and exactly 3 quadratics, a cubic CDS with a two-wings
chaotic attractor and exactly 1 cubic, and a quadratic CDS with a hidden chaotic attractor, and
unique and stable equilibrium, with exactly 5 quadratics; see Figure 1.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present some background theory; further
details are presented in Appendices A and B. In Section 3, we present some theory about mapping
DSs into structurally relatively simple CDSs using QCMs. This theory is then applied to study
chaos in CDSs in Section 4. Finally, we provide a summary and discussion in Section 5.

Background
In this section, we present some notation and background theory.
Notation. The spaces of real, non-negative and positive real numbers are denoted by R, R≥
and R>, respectively. Absolute value of x ∈R is denoted by |x|. Euclidean column vectors are
denoted by x = (x1, x2, . . . , xN)⊤∈RN, where ·⊤is the transpose operator. The Euclidean norm of
x ∈RN is given by ∥x∥= (x2
1 + x2
2 + . . .+x2
N)1/2 and, abusing the notation slightly, we also denote
by ∥· ∥the induced matrix norm. Operator nabla is given by ∇= (∂/∂x1, ∂/∂x2, . . . , ∂/∂xN).
2.1
Dynamical systems
Consider a system of autonomous ordinary-differential equations
dx
dt = f(x; n),
(1)
where t ∈R is time, x = (x1, x2, . . . , xN)⊤∈RN and f(x; n) = (f1(x; n), f2(x; n), . . . , fN(x; n))⊤∈
RN is a vector field with fi(·; n) : RN →R a polynomial of degree at most n for all i = 1, 2, . . . , N.
We say that (1) is an N-dimensional n-degree polynomial dynamical system (DS). For simplicity,
we assume that all the variables are dimensionless; furthermore, we assume that every equation
in (1) is written so that all of its monomials are distinct.
Key to this paper is a special subset of polynomial DSs.
Definition 2.1. (Chemical dynamical system) Assume that m(x) is a monomial in fi(x) such
that m(x) ≥0 when xi = 0 and xj ≥0 for all j ̸= i.
Then m(x) is said to be a chemical
monomial. If fi(x) contains only chemical monomials, then fi(x) is chemical; we then also say
that the ith equation from (1) is chemical. If every equation of (1) is chemical, then (1) is said to
be an N-dimensional n-degree (mass-action) chemical dynamical system (CDS).
If fi(x) is chemical, then fi(x) ≥0 when xi = 0 and xj ≥0 for all j ̸= i; consequently, the
CDS solution x(t; x0) ∈RN
≥is non-negative for all t ≥0, provided that is it non-negative initially,
x(0; x0) = x0 ∈RN
≥. Furthermore, variables x1, x2, . . . , xN from CDSs can be interpreted as (non-
negative) concentrations of chemical species, which react according to a set of reactions jointly
called a chemical reaction network (CRN) [11, 12]; see Appendix A for more details.
To characterize structural complexity of CDSs and CRNs, we introduce the following definition.
3


Definition 2.2. (Structural complexity) If f(x; n) contains exactly Mi monomials of degree i,
then DS (1) is said to be an n-degree (M0 +M1 +. . .+Mn, M2, M3, . . . , Mn) DS. If a CRN induced
by an n-degree CDS contains exactly Ri reactions of degree i, then it is said to be an n-degree
(R0 + R1 + . . . + Rn, R2, R3, . . . , Rn) CRN.
Remark. CDSs induce CRNs with Ri ≤Mi; see Appendix A and the examples below.
Transformation of variables. It is of great interest to analyze how CDSs behave under vari-
ous transformations of their variables. For example, CDSs are not invariant under general affine
transformations [10]. In particular, translating the dependent variables via x →(x −T), defined
as introducing the new variables ¯x = (x + T) in (1), in general transforms chemical DSs into non-
chemical ones, see also Section 3. Let us now consider two special affine maps: rescaling xi →sixi,
defined as introducing a new variable ¯xi = xi/si in (1), and permutation xi →xj, defined via new
variables ¯xi = xj and ¯xj = xi. It follows directly from Definition 2.1 that CDSs are invariant under
every rescaling with positive factors, and under every permutation, which we now formalize.
Lemma 2.1. (Positive scaling and permutation) Assume that DS (1) is chemical (respectively,
non-chemical). Then, under every rescaling xi →sixi with si > 0, and under every permutation
xi →xj, DS (1) remains chemical (respectively, non-chemical).
In what follows, when convenient, we permute and rescale the variables with suitable positive
factors, which does not change the chemical nature of DSs by Lemma 2.1. Furthermore, in N = 3
dimensions, we let x = x1, y = x2 and z = x3.
Example 2.1. Consider the three-dimensional quadratic DS
dx
dt = 1
5 −57
10x + xy,
dy
dt = −x −z,
dz
dt = y + 1
5z,
(2)
obtained via permutation x →z and then y →z in R¨ossler system [5]. By Definition 2.2, since
M0 = 1, M1 = 5 and M2 = 1, (2) is a (7, 1) DS. Function (−x −z) contains two non-chemical
monomials; hence, by Definition 2.1, (2) is not a CDS, and there is no associated CRN.
Example 2.2. Consider the three-dimensional quadratic (9, 6) DS
dx
dt = 30x −1
2x2 −xy −xz,
dy
dt = 33
2 y −1
2y2 −xy,
dz
dt = −10z + xz,
(3)
obtained from the minimal Willamowski–R¨ossler system [16, 17] via permutation y →z. Since
each of its equations is chemical, (3) is a CDS. Denoting by X, Y, Z the chemical species with
concentrations x, y, z, an associated CRN reads

where ∅denotes some species not explicitly modelled. By Definition 2.2, since R0 = 0, R1 = 3
and R2 = 6, (4) is a (9, 6) CRN. This network is called the canonical CRN of (3); there also exist
other, non-canonical, CRNs. In particular, since the terms xy in the first and second equations
of (3) are multiplied, up to sign, by the same coefficient, the two canonical reactions X + Y
1−→Y
and X + Y
1−→X can be fused into a single reaction X + Y
1−→∅. Similarly, X + Z
1−→Z and
X + Z
1−→X + 2Z can be fused into X + Z
1−→2Z. Using these two fused reactions, one obtains a

See Appendix A for more details on how to construct CRNs for any given CDS.
2.2
Chaos
Let us now discuss what is meant by chaos, starting with the following definition.
Definition 2.3. (Invariant set) Consider a set V ⊂RN in the state-space RN of DS (1). Assume
that the following statement holds: if x(0; x0) = x0 ∈V, then the solution x(t; x0) ∈V for all t ∈R.
Then, V is said to be an invariant set of DS (1). Furthermore, if there exists M > 0 such that
supt∈R∥x(t; x0)∥≤M for every x0 ∈V, then the invariant set V is said to be bounded.
Broadly speaking, a bounded invariant set V for DS (1) is chaotic if it has the following two
properties [1]: (P1) trajectories in V are “sensitive to initial conditions”, and (P2) V is “irreducible”;
V is said to be a chaotic attractor if additionally (P3) there exists a neighborhood U ⊃V such
that if x(0; x0) = x0 ∈U then x(t; x0) approaches V as t →∞. Properties (P1) and (P2) can be
defined in a number of non-equivalent ways [3]. For example, (P1) can be defined via existence of
a positive Lyapunov characteristic exponent (LCE) [20, 21], which implies that nearby trajectories
in V separate exponentially fast; see Appendix B for more details. Property (P2) can be defined
via existence of a trajectory dense in V. Note that some definitions of chaos impose additional
properties, such as existence of periodic trajectories that are dense in V, while other definitions
relax certain properties, such as not requiring that set V is bounded [3].
Definitions of chaos implicitly or explicitly exclude equilibria, trajectories connecting equilibria
and (quasi-)periodic trajectories from being considered chaotic sets.
Since these are the only
candidates for chaos in linear DSs of any finite dimension, and in two-dimensional DSs of any
degree by the Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem [1], it follows that (1) can display chaos only if dimension
N ≥3 and degree n ≥2. In this context, a number of three-dimensional quadratic DSs with only
one quadratic term have been presented as “minimal” chaotic systems, such as the (7, 1) R¨ossler
system (2) and fourteen (6, 1) Sprott systems F–S [6][Table 1].
Robustness. In this paper, we allow any definition of chaos as a bounded invariant set with
some properties P; the only restriction that we impose is that this set, and its properties, are
suitably robust. To formulate this, let us consider a perturbation of DS (1), given by
dx
dt = f(x; n) + p(x).
(6)
Definition 2.4. (Robustness) Let V ⊂RN be a bounded invariant set with properties P for
DS (1).
Assume that there exists a compact set U ⊃V such that for every sufficiently small
5


ε > 0 and every continuously differentiable function p(x) with maxx∈U(∥p(x)∥+ ∥∇p(x)∥) < ε the
perturbed DS (6) has a bounded invariant set V′ ⊂U with the same properties P. Then, invariant
set V of (1) and its properties P are said to be robust.
3
Theory: Quasi-chemical maps
Assume we are given a non-chemical DS (1) with a desired robust invariant set in RN (see Defi-
nition 2.4), and we wish to construct a CDS (see Definition 2.1) of the same dimension and with
such an invariant set in RN
>. To position this set into the positive orthant, one can appropriately
translate the dependent variables in (1). However, translations (and, more broadly, affine transfor-
mations) alone do not in general ensure that the resulting DS is chemical [10] - another non-linear
map must in general be applied that also preserves robust structures. A candidate map involves
perturbing DS (1) before suitable translations are applied.
Definition 3.1. (Quasi-chemical map) Assume that for polynomial functions f1(x), f2(x), . . . ,
fN(x) there exist polynomials p1(x; µ), p2(x; µ), . . . , pN(x; µ), with coefficients smooth in parame-
ters µ ∈Rp
>, and a vector T(µ) ∈RN
>, satisfying the following properties for every i = 1, 2, . . . , N.
(i) (Small perturbations) For every compact set U ⊂RN, and for every sufficiently small ∥µ∥,
maxx∈U|pi(x; µ)| is arbitrarily small.
(ii) (Large translations) For every sufficiently small ∥µ∥, ∥T(µ)∥is arbitrarily large.
(iii) (Chemicality) For every sufficiently small ∥µ∥, the perturbed function fi(x) + pi(x; µ) be-
comes chemical under the translation x →(x −T(µ)).
Then, the map from DS (1) to the CDS d¯x/dt = f(¯x −T(µ)) + p(¯x −T(µ); µ) is for every
sufficiently small ∥µ∥called a quasi-chemical map (QCM) induced by the perturbations p1(x; µ),
p2(x; µ), . . . , pN(x; µ), and the translation vector T(µ).
Remark.
Consisting only of (i) arbitrarily small smooth perturbations, and (ii) translations,
QCMs preserve robust structures. Furthermore, since translations can be arbitrarily large, every
bounded set U ⊂RN of DS (1) can be mapped into RN
> via QCMs.
This family of non-linear maps is introduced in [10], where it is shown that a particular QCM
universally maps polynomial DSs into CDSs. In other words, while it is in general not possible
to map a given polynomial DS to a CDS via only translations, it is always possible to do so for a
nearby perturbed polynomial DS; we now present this result rigorously.
Theorem 3.1. (Universal QCM) Every N-dimensional n-degree DS (1), with exactly Mn mono-
mials of degree n, can be mapped via a QCM to an N-dimensional (n+1)-degree CDS, with exactly
Mn+1 = Mn monomials of degree (n + 1).
Proof. This result is given as [10][Theorem 4.2]; for reader’s convenience, we reproduce the proof.
In particular, perturbing (1) via
dxi
dt = fi(x) + µ

xifi(x),
i = 1, 2, . . . , N,
(7)
for every a = (a1, a2, . . . , aN)⊤∈RN

with Mn monomials of degree (n + 1). By Definition 3.1, for every a ∈RN
> there exists µ0 > 0
such that for every µ ∈(0, µ0) the map from DS (1) to the CDS (8) is a QCM induced by the
perturbations pi(x; µ) = µxifi(x)/ai, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, and the translation vector T(µ) = a/µ.
Splitting. To systematically construct QCMs, let us split the ith equation from (1) as follows:
dxi
dt = fi(x) =
M
X
j=1
fi,j(x),
(9)
where fi,j(x) are arbitrary polynomials. Assume that one constructs a perturbation and translation
satisfying Definition 3.1(i)–(iii) for each of the functions fi,j(x) separately. If all of the translation
vectors are identical, then, by simply adding all of the perturbations to the full equation (9), one
obtains a chemical equation under the common translation. We now formalize this basic result.
Lemma 3.1. (Splitting lemma) Assume that, for every j = 1, 2, . . . , M, the function fi,j(x) +
pi,j(x; µ) becomes chemical under the translation x →(x −T(µ)) for every sufficiently small
∥µ∥. Let fi(x) be the function defined in (9), and pi(x; µ) = PM
j=1 pi,j(x; µ). Then, the function
fi(x) + pi(x; µ) also becomes chemical under x →(x −T(µ)) for every sufficiently small ∥µ∥.
Proof. Applying the translation ¯x = x + T(µ) on fi(x) + pi(x; µ), one obtains
fi (¯x −T(µ)) + pi (¯x −T(µ); µ) =
M
X
j=1
[fi,j (¯x −T(µ)) + pi,j (¯x −T(µ); µ)] .
(10)
By assumption, each of the summands is chemical for every sufficiently small ∥µ∥. Being a sum of
chemical functions, the left-hand side in (10) is then also chemical by Definition 2.1.
The QCM from Theorem 3.1 adds perturbations of identical form, with a single perturbation
parameter, to every equation, and is applicable to every polynomial DS; however, this universality
comes at a cost: a larger number of non-linear monomials can be introduced.
In this section,
we construct QCMs tailored to introduce a lower number of quadratic and cubic monomials; to
achieve this, perturbations of different form in general, with multiple perturbation parameters, are
added to different equations. In particular, in Section 3.1, we first construct some QCMs refined
to introduce a lower number of quadratics when applied on linear DSs. Then, in Section 3.2, we
present some QCMs that introduce a lower number of cubics when applied on quadratic DSs. To
reduce the number of both quadratics and cubics, these two classes of QCMs can be combined via
suitable splittings as per Lemma 3.1.

By Theorem 3.1, DS (11) is mapped via the universal QCM to a quadratic CDS with exactly
M1 quadratics. Using a suitable splitting as per Lemma 3.1, we now construct a QCM that can
lead to a lower number of quadratics. To this end, let M−
1,i be the total number of terms αi,jxj
with j ̸= i and αi,j < 0 in the ith equation of (11); we then let M−
1 = PN
i=1 M−
1,i.
Theorem 3.2. Every N-dimensional linear DS (11), with exactly M−
1 non-chemical first-degree
monomials, can be mapped via a QCM to an N-dimensional quadratic CDS with M2 ≤(M−
1 + N)
quadratic monomials.
Proof. Let us split DS (11) as follows:
dxi
dt = fi(x; 1) = li(x) + ri(x),
i = 1, 2, . . . , N,
(15)
with li(x) as in (12), with set Ii containing all the indices j ̸= i from (11) such that αi,j > 0, and
the remainder ri(x) = fi(x; 1)−li(x). Then, for every sufficiently small ε > 0 and for every a ∈RN

xiri(x),
i = 1, 2, . . . , N,

By Definition 3.1, the perturbations pi(x; ε, µ) = εx2
i + µxiri(x)/ai, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, and the trans-
lation vector a/µ, then induce a QCM for DS (11).
Every equation from (16) has (M−
1,i + 1)
quadratics; hence, the corresponding CDS has M2 = PN
i=1(M−
1,i + 1) = (M−
1 + N) quadratics.
The perturbation from Lemma 3.2 is quadratic. We now show that, if αi,i ≤0 in (12), then a
linear perturbation is sufficient.
Lemma 3.3. (Chemicality for (12) with αi,i ≤0) Assume that αi,i ≤0 in (12). Assume also

which, using (17), is chemical for every sufficiently small µ > 0 by Definition 2.1.
Remark. Lemma 3.3 implies that, if the ith equation from (11) has αi,i ≤0, then, under the
constraint (17), one can take pi(x; ε, µ) = −Ai,iεxi + µxiri(x)/ai in Theorem 3.2 to obtain a new
QCM achieving a CDS with M2 = (M−
1 + N −1) quadratics. In the extreme case when this can
be done for every equation of (11), one obtains a CDS with only M2 = M−
1 quadratics.
We close this section by constructing a QCM for a three-dimensional example; for notational
simplicity, we let x = x1, y = x2, z = x3, and a = a1, b = a2 and c = a3.

which, by Definition 2.2, is a quadratic (8, 5) CDS, i.e. it has M2 = 5 quadratics.
Let us now apply the results from this section to construct a CDS with only M2 = 2 quadratics.
To this end, let us split (20) as follows: f1(x) = l1(x) = 1/5 −57x/10, f2(x, z) = l2(x, z) = x + z
and f3(y, z) = r3(y, z) = −y + z/5. Perturbing l1(x) and l2(x, z) according to Lemma 3.3, and
r3(y, z) according to Theorem 3.1, one obtains

which is a quadratic (9, 2) CDS provided that, for every sufficiently small ε > 0, we choose any

Let us note that one can also use the splitting f3(y, z) =
l3(z) + r3(y), and perturb l3(z) = z/5 as per Lemma 3.2, and r3(y) = −y via Theorem 3.1; this
leads to the same quadratics in this particular example, because the third equation from (20) contains
no positive terms other than z/5.

where π(Si) denotes all the combinations of pairs from the set Si = {1, 2, . . . , i −1, i + 1, . . . , N}.
In what follows, we assume that (1) with n = 2 has at least one non-zero quadratic term. Let us
consider a special case, when the ith equation takes the form

which, using (26), is chemical for every sufficiently small µ > 0 by Definition 2.1.
Remark. If the coefficients βi,i, βi,j, δi,j,k > 0 and γi,j < 0, then, for every choice of aj > 0 with
j ̸= i, conditions (26) are satisfied by taking any ai > 0 sufficiently large. Therefore, conditions (26)
can also be satisfied if one or more of these coefficients are zero, provided that (25) is then perturbed
by (some of) the underlying missing quadratics, which we exploit in Theorem 3.3 below.
Remark. Conditions (26) are sufficient for chemicality. More generally, one can replace the first
inequality, which is linear, with the quadratic inequality obtained by demanding that the zero-
degree monomial in (27) is non-negative.
Remark. In this section, we focus on reducing the number of cubics. More broadly, to simultane-
ously decrease the number of linear and quadratic terms as well, one can redefine qi(x) by including
in it constant or suitable linear monomials. Conditions (26), possibly with strict inequalities, then
remain sufficient for chemicality. See Section 4.2 for some examples.
DS (24) can be mapped under the universal QCM from Theorem 3.1 to a cubic CDS with M2
cubics; the same is also true for every DS obtained from (24) via permutations or reflections of the
dependent variables. We now construct a QCM based on Lemma 3.4 that is more efficient.
Lemma 3.5. Every N-dimensional quadratic DS can be mapped via permutations and reflections to
DS (24) whose first equation contains monomial m(x) ∈{|β1,1|x2
1, −|γ1,2|x1x2, |β1,2|x2
2, |δ1,2,3|x2x3}.
Proof. Every N-dimensional quadratic DS can be mapped via a suitable permutation of the de-
pendent variables to DS (24) with monomial m(x) ∈{β1,1x2
1, −γ1,2x1x2, β1,2x2
2, δ1,2,3x2x3} in the
first equation.
If β1,1, β1,2, γ1,2, δ1,2,3 > 0, then the lemma follows.
Otherwise, proceed as fol-
lows: if m(x) ∈{−|β1,1|x2
1, −|β1,2|x2
2}, then apply the reflection x1 →−x1 to obtain a DS with
m(x) ∈{|β1,1|x2
1, |β1,2|x2
2}. Similarly, if m(x) = |γ1,2|x1x2 (respectively, m(x) = −|δ1,2,3|x2x3),
then apply x2 →−x2 (respectively, x2 →−x2 or x3 →−x3) to obtain m(x) = −|γ1,2|x1x2
(respectively, m(x) = |δ1,2,3|x2x3).
Theorem 3.3. Every N-dimensional quadratic DS (24), with exactly M2 quadratic monomials,
can be mapped via permutations, reflections and a QCM to an N-dimensional cubic CDS with
M3 ≤(M2 −1) cubic monomials.
Proof. By Lemma 3.5, up to permutations and reflections, we assume without a loss of gener-
ality that DS (24) has one of the four quadratic monomials m(x) in the first equation. Defining
remainders r1(x) = f1(x; 2)−m(x), and ri(x) = fi(x; 2), i = 2, 3, . . . , N, let us split (24) as follows:
dx1
dt = m(x) + r1(x),
dxi
dt = ri(x),
i = 2, 3, . . . , N.
(28)
Consider the perturbed equations
dx1
dt = m(x) + r1(x) + p(x; ε) + µ
a1
x1r1(x),
dxi
dt = ri(x) + µ
ai
xiri(x),
i = 2, 3, . . . , N,
(29)
where
(i) if m(x) = |β1,1|x2
1, then p(x; ε) ≡0,
11


(ii) if m(x) = −|γ1,2|x1x2, then p(x; ε) = εx2
1 and we choose a1 ≥|γ1,2|a2/ε,
(iii) if m(x) = |β1,2|x2
2, then p(x; ε) = ε(x2
1 −x1x2) and we choose a1 ≥2|β1,2|a2/ε,
(iv) if m(x) = |δ1,2,3|x2x3, then p(x; ε) = ε(x2
1−x1x2−x1x3) and we choose a1 ≥max{|δ1,2,3|a2/ε,
|δ1,2,3|a3/ε}.
In each of these four cases, the function q1(x) = m(x)+p(x; ε) is of the form given in (25), and the
conditions (26) hold for every sufficiently small ε > 0. Therefore, for every sufficiently small ε > 0
and the stated choice of a ∈RN
> there exists µ0 > 0 such that for every µ ∈(0, µ0) the perturbed
equations (29) become chemical under the translation x →x −a/µ by Lemma 3.4, Theorem 3.1
and Lemma 3.1. By Definition 3.1, the perturbations p1(x; ε, µ) = p(x; ε)+µx1r1(x)/a1, pi(x; µ) =
µxiri(x)/ai, i = 2, 3, . . . , N, and the translation vector a/µ, then induce a QCM for DS (24).
This QCM maps one of the M2 quadratic monomials into quadratics, and not a cubic; hence, the
resulting CDS has exactly M3 = (M2 −1) cubics.
Remark. Depending on the precise structure of (24), further reduction of cubic terms may be
possible via a more refined QCM: by including into q1(x) more quadratic terms from r1(x), and by
applying such splittings to the other equations as well. See Section 4.2 for an example.
Example 3.2. Consider R¨ossler system (2). Under the universal QCM from Theorem 3.1, (2)
maps to a cubic CDS. Let us now apply the results from this section to construct a QCM that
maps R¨ossler system into a quadratic CDS. To this end, as per Lemma 3.5, we apply the reflection
y →−y, thus obtaining
dx
dt = f1(x, y) = 1
5 −57
10x −xy,
dy
dt = f2(x, z) = x + z,
dz
dt = f3(y, z) = −y + z
5.
(30)
Let us split this DS as follows: f1(x, y) = m(x, y)+l1(x) with m(x, y) = −xy, f2(x, z) = l2(z)+r2(x)
with l2(z) = z, and f3(y, z) = r3(y, z). Perturbing then m(x, y) according to Theorem 3.3(ii), l1(x)
and l2(z) according to Lemma 3.3, and r2(x) and r3(y, z) via Theorem 3.1, one obtains
dx
dt = 1

(31)
Under the translation (¯x, ¯y, ¯z) = (x, y, z) + (a, b, c)/µ, the perturbed DS (31) becomes

(32)
For every ε > 0, choosing any a, b, c > 0 such that a ≥b/ε and b ≥c/ε, it follows that, for every
sufficiently small µ > 0, (32) is a quadratic (12, 5) CDS.

Applications to chaos
In this section, we apply the theory developed in Section 3 to quadratic DSs with up to two quadratic
monomials to study the capacity of chemical and biological systems for chaos.
In particular,
prioritizing reduction in the number of the highest-degree monomials and reactions, we construct
three relatively simple CDSs displaying chaotic attractors with various properties.
4.1
Chaotic DSs with one quadratic monomial
By Theorem 3.3, every quadratic DS, with only one quadratic term, can be mapped to a quadratic
CDS; in the context of chaos, we then have the following result.
Theorem 4.1. Assume that N-dimensional quadratic DS, with only one quadratic monomial, has
a robust bounded invariant set in RN with robust properties P that are invariant under permuta-
tions, reflections and translations of the dependent variables. Then, there exists an N-dimensional
quadratic CDS with a bounded invariant set in RN
> with properties P.
Proof. By Theorem 3.3, every N-dimensional quadratic DS, with only one quadratic monomial,
can be mapped to an N-dimensional quadratic CDS via permutations, reflections and a QCM, the
latter of which consists purely of smooth perturbations of the vector field and translations of the
dependent variables by Definition 3.1. By Definition 2.4, robust invariant sets and robust properties
are preserved under such perturbations, implying the statement of the theorem.
Theorem 4.1 implies that, assuming robust chaos, the R¨ossler system (2), and the Sprott systems
F–S [6][Table 1], can all be mapped to quadratic CDSs with chaos.

Figure 2: Quadratic (11, 5) chemical R¨ossler system. Panels (a) and (b) display respectively the
(y, z)- and (t, y)-space for the reflected R¨ossler system (30) with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(5, −5, 5); panel (c) shows time-evolution of the three LCEs for this solution, along with the values
at t = 106 as dashed black lines. Analogous plots are shown in panels (d)–(f) for the perturbed
R¨ossler system (31), and in (g)–(i) for its translated and rescaled version (33) with the translated
and rescaled initial condition x0 = εµ(5 + (ε2µ)−1), y0 = −5 + (εµ)−1, z0 = 5ε(5 −ε)−1(5 + µ−1).
The parameters are fixed to (a, b, c) = (ε−2, ε−1, 1) and (ε, µ) = (10−3, 10−2).
14


Proof. By assumption, (2) has a robust chaotic attractor; therefore, by Definition 2.4, there exists
ε0 > 0 such that for every ε ∈(0, ε0), and for every a, b, c > 0, there exists µ0 > 0 such that for
every µ ∈(0, µ0) the perturbed system (31) also has a robust chaotic attractor. Being a translation
of (31), DS (32) also has a robust chaotic attractor, which is in R3
> for every sufficiently small µ.
Choosing any a, b, c > 0 such that a ≥b/ε and b ≥c/ε ensures that (32) is chemical. To reduce
the number of the induced chemical reactions, let us choose b = c/ε and e.g. a = c/ε2 and c = 1,
under which choice the CDS becomes

(36)
To further reduce the number of reactions, let us rescale via ¯x →¯x/(εµ) and ¯z →(1/ε −1/5)¯z,
which ensures that the terms ¯x¯y in the first and second equations, and the terms z in the second and
third equations, are multiplied, up to sign, by the same coefficients, thus allowing for fusion of the
underlying reactions (see Appendix A). Removing the bars, (36) then becomes the CDS (33).
Example 4.1. Under the parameter choice ε = 10−3 and µ = 10−2, CDS (33) becomes
dx
dt = 5700.000002 −100005.7x + 1000y + 100x2 −xy,
dy
dt = −1000.001y + 999.8z + xy,
dz
dt = 999.8z + 1.9996z2 −0.01yz.
(37)
In Figure 2(a), we display the numerically observed chaotic attractor of the (reflected) R¨ossler
system (30) in the (y, z)-space, while in Figure 2(b) the corresponding trajectory in the (t, y)-space.
Furthermore, in Figure 2(c), we show the three finite-time LCEs over the time-interval t ∈[0, 50],
along with the values at t = 106 shown as the dashed lines. The positive LCE is consistent with
chaos; see Appendix B for more details about LCEs, including a numerical method used in this
paper to approximate them. Analogous plots are shown in Figure 2(d)–(f) for the perturbed R¨ossler
system (31) with b = ε−1 and c = 1; parameters ε = 10−3 and µ = 10−2 are chosen so that there is a
good match with the original attractor. In particular, note that the LCEs of (31) are relatively close
to of those of (30), numerically indicating robustness of the underlying chaotic attractor. Finally, in
Figure 2(g)–(i), we show analogous plots for the perturbed, translated and rescaled CDS (33), which
is under the chosen parameter values equivalent to (37). Note that, since infinite-time LCEs are
invariant under affine transformations, systems (31) and (33) have identical LCEs in the long-run.
4.1.1
One-wing chaos
The (11, 5) chemical R¨ossler system (33) with (9, 4) CRN (34) has one fewer quadratic than the
(9, 6) Willamowski–R¨ossler system (3) with (7, 4) CRN (5); however, they contain the same number
of quadratic reactions. Let us now construct an even simpler CDS with one-wing chaos. To this

Assume that DS (38) has a robust one-wing chaotic attractor in R3. Then, CDS (39) has a one-wing
chaotic attractor in R3
> for every sufficiently small ε > 0 and µ > 0.
Proof. Let us split DS (38) as follows: f1(x, y) = −y + x2 = m(x) + r1(y) with m(x) = x2,
f2(x, z) = 27x/10 + z = l2(x, z) and f3(x, y) = x + y = l3(x) + r3(y) with l3(x) = x. Perturbing
then m(x, y) according to Theorem 3.3(i), l2(x, z) and l3(x) according to Lemma 3.3, and r1(y)
and r3(y) via Theorem 3.1, one obtains

Sufficient to make this system chemical is by choosing b = a/ε2 + 27a/(10ε), c = a/ε and e.g.

ε2 + 27
10ε −2
µ|¯x and ¯y →27¯y/10, the monomials ¯x are multiplied,
up to sign, by the same coefficients, thus allowing for fusion of the underlying three reactions (see
Appendix A). Removing the bars, DS (43) then becomes the CDS (39), and the theorem then
follows from the assumption that the chaotic attractor of (38) and its one-wingedness are robust,
and from the fact that one-wingedness is invariant under affine transformations.
Example 4.2. Let us choose ε = µ = 10−2 in (41). The numerically observed one-wing chaotic
attractor of CDS (39) is then shown in the (x, y)-space in Figure 3(d), while in Figure 3(e) in
the (t, x)-space. The associated LCEs are shown in Figure 3(f), and are relatively close to those
of (38). See also Figure 1(a) for the one-wing chaotic attractor in the (x, y, z)-space.

4.2
Chaotic DSs with two quadratic monomials
For quadratic DSs with only two quadratic terms, Theorem 3.3 implies the following result.
Theorem 4.4. Assume that N-dimensional quadratic DS, with only two quadratic monomials, has
a robust bounded invariant set in RN with robust properties P that are invariant under permutations,
reflections and translations of the dependent variables. Then, there exists an N-dimensional cubic
CDS, with at most one cubic monomial, with a bounded invariant set in RN
> with properties P.
Proof. The statement of the theorem follows by analogous arguments as for Theorem 4.1.
Using the Lorenz system [7], one can then deduce the following result, which can be seen as an
improvement of [10][Theorem 5.2].
Corollary 4.1. There exists a three-dimensional cubic CDS, with only one cubic monomial, that
has a chaotic attractor in R3
>.
Proof. The corollary follows from Theorem 4.4 and the fact that the three-dimensional quadratic
(7, 2) Lorenz system has a robust chaotic attractor [9].
4.2.1
Two-wing chaos
The three-dimensional quadratic (7, 2) Lorenz and the (5, 2) Sprott systems B–C [6][Table 1] display
two-wing chaotic attractors, and can by Theorem 3.3 all be mapped to three-dimensional cubic
CDSs with only one cubic. In what follows, we perform this construction on the Sprott system C;
in particular, consider the DS
dx
dt = −1 + y2,
dy
dt = −xz,
dz
dt = y −z,
(44)
obtained via permutation y →z, then x →y and then reflection x →−x in the Sprott system C.
See Figure 4(a)–(c) for the underlying chaotic attractor and the LCEs.

Assume that DS (44) has a robust two-wing chaotic attractor in R3. Then, CDS (45) has a two-wing
chaotic attractor in R3
> for every sufficiently small ε > 0 and µ > 0.
Proof. Let us split DS (44) as follows: f1(y) = −1 + y2 = q1(y), f2(x, z) = −xz = r2(x, z) and
f3(y, z) = y −z = l3(y, z). Perturbing then q1(y) according to Theorem 3.3(iii), l3(y, z) according
to Lemma 3.3, and r2(x, z) via Theorem 3.1, one obtains

(49)
To make this system chemical, it is sufficient to choose a = 2b/ε, c = b and e.g. b = 1. By then
rescaling via ¯y →¯y/ε and ¯z →µ¯z/2, the monomials ¯x¯y, as well as ¯y, are multiplied, up to sign,
by the same coefficients, thus allowing for fusion of the underlying reactions (see Appendix A).
Removing the bars, DS (49) then becomes the CDS (45), and the theorem then follows from the
assumption that the chaotic attractor of (44) and its two-wingedness are robust, and the fact that
two-wingedness is invariant under affine transformations.
Example 4.3. Let us choose ε = 10−3 and µ = 10−2 in (47). The numerically observed two-wing
chaotic attractor of CDS (45) is then shown in the (x, y)-space in Figure 4(d); the (t, y)-space is
shown in Figure 4(e). The corresponding LCEs are displayed in Figure 4(f), and are relatively close
to those of DS (44). See also Figure 1(b) for the two-wing chaotic attractor in the (x, y, z)-space.
4.2.2
Hidden chaos
The chaotic attractors considered in the previous sections can be detected via equilibria: by choosing
an initial condition sufficiently close to some unstable equilibrium, the corresponding trajectory
converges to the chaotic attractor in the long-run. In this section, we consider chaotic attractors
that are hidden from equilibria [4].
Definition 4.1. (Hidden chaos) Consider DS (1) with a chaotic attractor V. Assume that the
following statement is false: for some equilibrium x∗of (1) and for every ε > 0 there exists an
initial condition x0 with ∥x0 −x∗∥< ε such that the solution x(t; x0) of (1) converges to V as
t →∞. Then, V is said to be a hidden chaotic attractor of (1).
It follows from Definition 4.1 that sufficient for a chaotic attractor to be hidden is that the
corresponding DS has no equilibria, or only stable equilibria. In this context, 23 three-dimensional
quadratic DSs with chaos and a unique and stable equilibrium have been reported in [8]; these DSs
contain 7 or 8 monomials in total, of which 2 or 3 are quadratic. Let us consider the quadratic DS

dt = 57
100 −31
10z −1

10xz,
dy
dt = −y −z,

obtained via permutation x →z and reflection y →−y in SE17 from [8][Table 1]. The hidden
chaotic attractor, and the unique and stable equilibrium, are displayed in the (x, y)-space in Fig-
ure 5(a); the trajectory in the (t, x)-space is shown in Figure 5(b), with the LCEs in Figure 5(c).
Theorem 3.3 guarantees that (50) can be mapped to a one-cubic-term CDS, but not necessarily
to a quadratic CDS. Furthermore, (smooth) perturbations of the vector field in general introduce

additional equilibria, i.e. having a unique equilibrium is not a robust property of DSs; consequently,
CDSs obtained from (50) via QCMs in general have multiple equilibria. We now design a QCM
that overcomes these issues: both the degree and equilibrium uniqueness of (50) are preserved.

Assume that DS (50) has a robust chaotic attractor in R3. Then, CDS (51) has a unique and stable
equilibrium, and a hidden chaotic attractor, in R3
> for every sufficiently small ε > 0 and µ > 0.
Proof. Let us split DS (50) as follows: f1(x, y, z) = 57/100 −31z/10 −xy/5 −3xz/10 = q1(x, y, z),
f2(y, z) = −y −z = l2(y) + r2(z) with l2(y) = −y, and f3(x) = x = r3(x). Perturbing then
q1(x, y, z) with εx2, to satisfy the conditions (26) from Lemma 3.4, l2(y) according to Lemma 3.3,
and r2(z) and r3(x) via Theorem 3.1, one obtains

,
(55)
which, for every sufficiently small ε > 0 and µ > 0, being a perturbation of the hyperbolic and
stable equilibrium of (50), is itself hyperbolic and stable. Every other equilibrium (x∗, y∗, z∗) of (54)
satisfies 0 = (c/b−1)y∗+c/µ; to this end, we choose c = b, which ensures that the equilibrium (55)
is unique. Translating then via (¯x, ¯y, ¯z) = (x, y, z) + (a, b, b)/µ, one obtains

Sufficient to make this system chemical is with b = 2εa; we then e.g. fix a = 1/ε to make b = O(1).
Then, rescaling via ¯x →(31/10 + 57µ/200)¯x and ¯z →(5/3)µ(31/10 + 57µ/200)¯z, the monomials
¯x¯z, as well as 1, are multiplied, up to sign, by the same coefficients, thus allowing for fusion of the
underlying reactions (see Appendix A). Removing the bars, DS (56) then becomes the CDS (51),
and the theorem then follows from the assumption that the chaotic attractor of (50) is robust.
Example 4.4. Let us choose ε = µ = 10−5 in (53), under which the unique equilibrium of (51)
is stable. The numerically observed hidden chaotic attractor, together with the equilibrium, are
shown in the (x, y)-space in Figure 5(d); the corresponding (t, y)-space is shown in Figure 5(e).
The associated LCEs are displayed in Figure 5(f), and are close to those of the DS (50). See also
Figure 1(c) for the hidden chaotic attractor and the equilibrium in the (x, y, z)-space.

Discussion
In this paper, we have developed some fundamental theory about mapping polynomial dynamical
systems (DSs) into dynamically similar chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) of the same dimension
22


and with a reduced number of non-linear terms. We have then applied this theory to investigate the
capacity of chemical and biological systems to display chaotic behaviors with various properties.
In particular, in Section 3, we have developed some theory about the so-called quasi-chemical
maps (QCMs). These maps, put forward in [10], can transform polynomial DSs into CDSs purely
via smooth perturbations of the vector field and translations of the dependent variables, thereby
preserving both the dimension and robust structures. In Section 3.1, we have constructed some
QCMs that can map linear DSs into quadratic CDSs with a lower number of quadratics. Using
one such map, we have proved in Theorem 3.2 that every N-dimensional linear DS, with M−
1
non-chemical linear monomials, can be mapped to an N-dimensional quadratic CDS with at most
(M−
1 +N) quadratics. Similarly, in Section 3.2, we have constructed QCMs that can map quadratic
DSs into cubic CDSs with a lower number of cubics. One such map has been used to prove in
Theorem 3.3 that every quadratic DS, with M2 quadratic monomials, can be mapped to a cubic
CDS with at most (M2 −1) cubics. To reduce the number of both quadratics and cubics, these
different QCMs can be combined into a single composite one by suitably splitting DSs, as outlined
in Lemma 3.1. This approach has then been used in Section 4 to investigate chaos in CDSs.
In particular, in Section 4.1, we have constructively proved in Theorem 4.1 that every quadratic
DS, with only one quadratic monomial and robust chaos, can be mapped to a quadratic CDS of the
same dimension and with the robust chaos preserved. A number of such DSs have been put forward,
such as the R¨ossler [5] and Sprott systems F–S [6]. Assuming existence of robust chaos in these
DSs, Theorem 4.1 then shows that three-dimensional quadratic CDSs can display a range of chaotic
behaviors. As a concrete example, we have constructed in Theorem 4.2 the chemical R¨ossler system
- a quadratic (11, 5) CDS, with 11 monomials of which exactly 5 are quadratic, with (9, 4) chemical
reaction network (CRN), with 9 reactions of which exactly 4 are quadratic, displaying the R¨ossler
attractor. This CDS is simpler, when it comes to the number of quadratics, than the minimal (9, 6)
Willamowski–R¨ossler system [16, 17] with (7, 4) CRN. We have then constructed in Theorem 4.3 a
quadratic (10, 3) CDS with (8, 3) CRN and a chaotic attractor with one wing, shown in Figure 1(a).
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is currently the three-dimensional quadratic CDS with
observed chaos that has the lowest number of quadratic monomials and reactions.
In Section 4.2, we have constructively proved in Theorem 4.4 that every quadratic DS, with only
two quadratic monomials and robust chaos, can be mapped to a cubic CDS, with at most one cubic
monomial, of the same dimension and with the robust chaos preserved. A number of such DSs have
been reported, such as the Lorenz [7] and Sprott systems A–E [6][Table 1], and many others [8, 4].
Existence of a robust chaotic attractor is proved for the Lorenz system [9]; hence, one obtains
Corollary 4.1, guaranteeing existence of a three-dimensional cubic CDS with only one cubic and a
chaotic attractor. More broadly, assuming the other DSs also have robust chaos, Theorem 4.4 shows
that three-dimensional cubic CDSs can realize a rich set of chaotic behaviors already with only one
cubic monomial. To showcase this, we have constructed a cubic (11, 5, 1) CDS with (9, 4, 1) CRN
in Theorem 4.5 that displays a chaotic attractor with two wings; see Figure 1(b). Furthermore,
in Theorem 4.6, we have presented a quadratic (11, 5) CDS with (9, 4) CRN displaying a hidden
chaotic attractor, and a stable and unique equilibrium, displayed in Figure 1(c). To the best of
the author’s knowledge, these two CDSs have the lowest number of highest-degree monomials and
reactions reported to this day in the context of the two-wing and hidden chaos; in fact, (51) appears
to be the first three-dimensional CDS with hidden chaos and unique equilibrium reported.
We close this paper with three sets of open questions about three-dimensional CDSs with
chaos.
Firstly, is there a quadratic CDS with a (one-wing) chaotic attractor and less than 3
quadratic monomials, or less than 3 quadratic reactions? Is there a quadratic CDS with a two-
wing chaotic attractor? Is there a CDS with a chaotic attractor and stable and unique equilibrium
23


with less than 5 quadratic monomials, or less than 4 quadratic reactions?
Is there a cubic or
quadratic CDS with a chaotic attractor and no equilibria? What is the lowest number of linear
monomials in all such CDSs? Secondly, the QCMs, used to systematically construct the CDSs
in this paper, rely on the perturbation parameters ε, µ > 0, which have to take sufficiently small
values in order for the target chaotic set to persist under the perturbations. The “less robust”
a chaotic set, the smaller one requires the parameter values. Consequences of these small values
are that the polynomial coefficients in the constructed CDSs, as well as the regions in the state-
space where the chaotic sets are positioned, can span many orders of magnitude, see e.g. (37)
and Figure 1. Can one systematically construct CDSs of similar complexity as in this paper, but
without such scale separations? Finally, chaotic attractors in the DSs considered in this paper in
general have a bounded region of attraction, beyond which the solutions may grow unboundedly,
and the constructed CDSs can inherit such behaviors. Can one systematically construct globally
bounded chaotic CDSs, without significantly increasing their structural complexity?

Appendix: Chemical reaction networks
Every CDS induces a canonical set of chemical reactions [11]. In what follows, given any x ∈R,
we define the sign function as sign(x) = −1 if x < 0, sign(x) = 0 if x = 0, and sign(x) = 1 if x > 0.
Definition A.1. (Chemical reaction network) Assume that (1) is a CDS. Let m(x) = αxν1

be a monomial from fi(x), where α ∈R and ν1, ν2, . . . , νN are non-negative integers. Then, the
monomial m(x) = sign(α)|α|xν1

where Xi denotes the chemical species whose concentration is xi. The set of all such chemical
reactions, induced by all the monomials in the vector field f(x), is called the canonical chemical
reaction network ( CRN) induced by (1).
Remark. Terms of the form 0Xi are denoted by ∅, and interpreted as some neglected species.
For any given CDS, the induced canonical CRN from Definition A.1 is unique. However, a given
CDS can also induce other, non-canonical, CRNs.

Any network obtained by fusing reactions in the canonical CRN is called a non-canonical CRN.
Remark. Fusion is possible when a monomial appears in multiple equations of (1) and is multiplied,
up to sign, by identical coefficients.

Appendix: Lyapunov characteristic exponents
Let x(t; x0) ∈RN be the solution of (1) with initial value x(0; x0) = x0. Then, the linearization
of (1) around x(t; x0) is the N-dimensional linear non-autonomous DS
dw
dt = ∇f(x(t; x0))w,
w(0) = w0,
(58)
where ∇f(x) ∈RN×N is the Jacobian of f(x). To measure the rate of change of w = w(t; x(t; x0), w0)
in comparison with the exponential function exp(t), we define the following quantity [20, 21].
Definition B.1. (Lyapunov characteristic exponent) The finite-time Lyapunov characteristic
exponent ( LCE) of solution x(t; x0) of (1) with respect to the perturbation w0 ̸= 0 is the scalar
λ(·; x0, w0) : R →R given by
λ(t; x0, w0) ≡1
t ln ∥w(t; x(t; x0), w0)∥,
(59)
where w = w(t; x(t; x0), w0) is the solution of (58). Assuming existence, the corresponding infinite-
time LCE is given by λ∞(x0, w0) ≡limt→∞λ(t; x0, w0).
If the solution x(t; x0) is bounded for all t ∈R, then it has at most N distinct infinite-time
LCEs, all of which are finite [21]; furthermore, if limt→∞x(t; x0) is not an equilibrium, then one
of the LCEs is zero [22].
In addition, infinite-time LCEs are invariant under affine change of
coordinates [21]. Furthermore, under suitable conditions [21, 23], trajectories in chaotic attractors
have a negative, zero and a positive infinite-time LCE, and the sum of the LCEs is negative.
Computation of LCEs. Let matrix X(t; x0) ∈RN×N contain as its ith column solution
w(t; x(t; x0), ei) ∈RN of (58) with initial condition w0 = ei, the ith standard basis vector in RN;
then X(t; x0) is called the matriciant (fundamental matrix) of (58) [21]. Having linearly indepen-
dent columns, it admits the QR-factorization X(t) = Q(t)R(t), with Q(t) ∈RN×N orthogonal and
R(t) ∈RN×N upper-triangular with non-negative diagonal elements Ri,i(t) ≥0. Under suitable
regularity conditions, the N infinite-time LCEs are given by λ∞,i = limt→∞(1/t) ln Ri,i(t) [21, 23],
and can therefore be approximated with λi(t) = (1/t) ln Ri,i(t) with t sufficiently large.
However, the elements of X(t; x0) can change exponentially fast with time, and can therefore
take values smaller (underflow) or larger (overflow) in magnitude than representable on a computer
for the desired values of t. To this end, let us use the matriciant identity
X(mτ; x0) = X(τ; x((m −1)τ))X(τ; x((m −2)τ)) . . . X(τ; x(τ))X(τ; x0),
(60)
for every integer m > 0 and time-step τ > 0. To address the numerical issues, one can choose τ > 0
sufficiently small, solve (1) and (58) to determine each of the factors on the right-hand side of (60),
and then compute the QR-factorization (m −1) times iteratively as follows: X(τ; x0) = Q1R1,
X(τ; x(τ))Q1 = Q2R2, . . ., X(τ; x((m −1)τ))Qm−1 = QmRm, leading to
X(mτ; x0) = QmRmRm−1 . . . R2R1.
(61)
Using this composite QR-factorization, the N infinite-time LCEs can be approximated with
λi(t) = 1

with sufficiently large t = mτ and sufficiently small τ > 0. In this paper, we use this discrete QR
algorithm to compute the LCEs; see e.g. [23, 24] for more details.
