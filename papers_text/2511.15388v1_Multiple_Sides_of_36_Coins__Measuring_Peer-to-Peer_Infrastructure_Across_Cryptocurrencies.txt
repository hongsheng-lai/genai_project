Blockchain technologies underpin an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, financial systems,
and infrastructure. However, the fundamental networking layer that sustains these systems, the peer-to-peer
(P2P) layer, of all but the top few ecosystems remains largely opaque. In this paper, we present the first
longitudinal, cross-network measurement study of 36 public blockchain networks. Over 9 months (since late
2024), we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted
hourly connectivity probes (e.g., pings and protocol-level handshakes) to observe the evolving state of these
networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum’s discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional
19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide
scans, which only require probing each protocol’s default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This
approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to
implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin
and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly.
Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We
quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and
characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings
expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing
each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at
scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of
blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.

Introduction
Decentralized systems rely on robust and efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) networking layers to propagate
transactions, blocks, and state updates across thousands of participants. In blockchain networks,
the P2P layer is foundational not only for consensus and availability but also for performance,
censorship resistance, and resilience to churn. Despite its importance, the structure and behavior of
blockchain P2P networks remain poorly understood, due in part to the lack of sustained, large-scale
measurement across multiple chains.
However, a better understanding is critical. On the one hand, recent regulatory proposals assess
scale and control in crypto networks (e.g., activity thresholds under EU MiCA [76, 92] and decentral-
ization tests in U.S. proposals [67]). While statutes rarely directly key in on “node count”, regulators

and risk assessors use network size and concentration as evidence of resilience or potential gover-
nance capture. On the other hand, due to the permissionless nature of the protocol, it is difficult for
protocol designers and maintainers themselves to understand the size and characteristics of the
network [14]. For example, a good understanding of the location of nodes plays a crucial role in
the design and performance of next-generation blockchain protocols [48, 79].
In this paper, we present the first longitudinal, multi-chain measurement study of blockchain P2P
networks, covering 36 networks including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, among others.
From early 2025 onward, we operated 15 dedicated crawlers, incorporated external data from one
community crawler, and implemented hourly reachability checks (TCP probes and in-protocol
handshakes). To complement this, we performed full IPv4 address space scans (and partial IPv6)
for selected protocols using custom payloads and scraped six node explorers to compare crawler
coverage. Notably, by analyzing the Ethereum (via discv4 and discv5) and the Bitcoin Cash discovery
data, we inferred the existence and metadata of 19 additional networks.
Our methodology enables a comprehensive view of these P2P layers. We then build on this
foundation to analyze structural properties such as churn, geographic and AS-level centralization,
peer table characteristics, and inter-network overlap. Together, these analyses uncover substan-
tial diversity in design, scale, and decentralization across blockchain networks. We reveal stark
differences in network size (ranging from tens to tens of thousands of nodes), reachability (some
networks exhibit <10% reachable nodes), and peer discovery coverage (how much of the network
is revealed by querying a small subset of nodes). We explore IP and AS-level centralization, the use
of IPv6, temporal churn behaviors, and quantify peer discovery effectiveness. For example, we find
that in some networks, fewer than five nodes need to be contacted to discover 90% of reachable
peers, while others exhibit much flatter coverage.
We begin with an overview of the peer discovery process of the blockchain systems we study in
Section 2, and our methodology for our 15 network crawlers (summarized in Table 1) and general
data collection in Sections 3 and 4. We present results from our diverse suite of measurement
techniques in Section 5, culminating in network size estimates for all 36 blockchain networks.
We then provide extensive analysis of properties of these networks in Section 6, where we have
the data. We conclude in Section 7. All measurement code will be made publicly available to the
community.

Related work
Network measurements of blockchain systems have primarily focused on the Bitcoin and Ethereum
blockchains. Decker et al. [26] were the first to measure Bitcoin, focusing on message propagation
in the network. Other network propagation measurements of Bitcoin include [24, 65, 68]. Several
measurements of Bitcoin have looked at node properties such as size, location, and churn [29,
45, 56, 69]. There is also work on methodologies to estimate the size of unreachable nodes in
Bitcoin [40, 87] (estimated at two-thirds of the network).
Gencer et al [39] measured peers and propagation in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a focus on
decentralization metrics, while Kiffer et al. [47] focused on the impact of network churn on
information quality in the Ethereum network. Previous measurements of Ethereum have looked
at the topological properties of the peer tables [37], and very recent works have measured the
discovery protocols of Ethereum and their clients [50, 54].
Several works take advantage of network-level messages to infer peering connections in Bitcoin
and Ethereum [27, 51, 59, 64]. Others have studied peer discovery in Bitcoin and Ethereum, looking
at Eclipsing attacks [41, 43, 55], AS-level partitioning attacks [3, 75]. Heimbach et al. [42] ran
network-level measurements of Ethereum’s Consensus network, looking at general decentralization
metrics, and running an attack to extrapolate which nodes participate in the consensus protocol.

Measurements of other blockchain networks are sparse. Early work (from 2016), which crawled
Ethereum, Bitcoin, Peercoin, and Namecoin [2], Cao et al. [15] crawled Monero, and Daniel et
al. [25] Z-cash. There are several works looking at the Lightning Network (a layer-two of Bitcoin)
topology, which is publicly advertised [20, 57, 73]. Prior to the age of cryptocurrencies, several
works measured the P2P networks of the early 2000s – such as Gnutella, Kad, BitTorrent, and
several P2P-TVs – looking at similar properties such as size, churn, and traffic [8, 22, 74, 77, 83].
2
Background
Unlike traditional client-server architectures, P2P networks rely on a flat topology where nodes act
as both clients and servers, directly exchanging information and resources. Efficient peer discovery
is required to maintain robustness, scalability, and security in cryptocurrency networks because
these networks are generally designed to be open and permissionless, and can undergo heavy
churn. Peer discovery protocols determine how nodes learn about and connect to others, directly
impacting consensus, data propagation [47], and resistance to attacks [3, 41, 43]. To facilitate this,
many blockchain networks employ variants of structured or unstructured discovery mechanisms,
many inspired by distributed hash table (DHT) protocols. Across these mechanisms, a node typically
maintains a “peer table” or routing table that organizes known nodes according to identifiers such
as node IDs, IP addresses, or connectivity metrics. These tables represent a partial view of the
network, whose sizes vary significantly by protocol (from tens to over a thousand).
Although there are many blockchain protocols, the client code for many of them is not entirely
unique. Bitcoin’s code base has been forked and reused in many existing systems, including
Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash,1 among others. All these inherit the same peer table and peer
discovery mechanism of Bitcoin. There are several protocols, including Ethereum, Polkadot, and
Filecoin, among others, whose peer table structure and peer discovery mechanism are based on the
Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT) [58]. Other protocols still share some characteristics. We
summarize the key characteristics of the protocols studied in this paper below.
We omit Cardano below as until recently, their networking stack did not offer peer discovery, and
instead relied on static topology files obtained from a centralized source [16]. Currently, Cardano
relies on trusted relays to obtain peer information, with steps towards decentralized discovery in
the works [44].
2.1
Peer tables
Each node keeps some local information of the network, usually in the form of a peer table or
routing table. This is generally not a table of who they are actively connected to, i.e., have an
established TCP connection with, but rather a sample of the network they can reference to try and
establish a connection to when they need a new peer.
Bitcoin-based clients. Bitcoin and its variants (in this work this includes Dogecoin, Bitcoin
Cash, and Litecoin) keep track of two peer tables. The new tables stores recently-propagated
IPs which can hold up to 66K addresses, while the tried table stores IPs the node has previously
established a connection with and holds around 16K addresses. In Bitcoin, there is no peer ID, all
nodes are referenced solely by their IP:port information. The peer table does keep some connectivity
information (e.g., time since last connection, time in table) which it uses to eject old peers when
new ones are added. Periodically (every two minutes) a peer is chosen from the new table, and is
promoted to the tried table if the node is able to make a short-lived feeler connection to it. When a
node needs a new connection, it samples randomly from both tables. More information on peer
table maintenance can be found in [85].
1Bitcoin Cash is not only a code fork, but it used to be part of the Bitcoin blockchain, so it is in fact a blockchain fork.

DHT-based clients. While various Distributed Hash Table (DHT) designs exist, this study focuses
exclusively on Kademlia-based DHTs [58], specifically the discv4 [33], discv5 [34], and libp2p [72]
implementations. In Kademlia, derived from a public key, each peer is assigned a unique node/peer
ID within a shared fixed-size XOR keyspace. The protocol defines distance as the bitwise XOR of two
node IDs, enabling efficient and symmetric routing. Each node maintains a routing table organized
into 𝑘-buckets, where each bucket covers a range of XOR distances that grow exponentially with
respect to a node’s ID. This structure ensures that routing queries proceed toward peers that are
increasingly closer to a target ID, achieving logarithmic lookup complexity. Despite implementation
differences, the analyzed systems share these core Kademlia properties and can be treated within a
common analytical framework.
Others. Of the other protocols studied in this work, many implement a simpler peer maintenance
mechanism than the ones described above. The common approach is to keep a general cache of
discovered nodes (IP:port and public ID) with some protocol-specific additional information for
pruning/cleaning the table. In the Ripple protocol, each entry has a hop counter for if the node is a
direct peer or peer of a peer, etc. and peer tables have a default size of 256 nodes [90]. In Avalanche,
nodes keep some priority information (e.g., if the peer is a validator, successful connection attempts,
and their subnets) with default size of between 2000–5000 nodes, depending on release [7]. Both the
Stellar and Near protocols nodes keep a default of 1K peers in their discovery cache and similar
connectivity metrics (e.g., number of successful attempts, last connection, etc.) [61, 80, 81].
2.2
Peer discovery
Periodically nodes ask their peers to whom they have an active connection for some new node
information so they can learn about more nodes in the network and update their peer tables. This
process also varies by network, including the number of nodes returned, how they choose which
information to share, and if the querying client can probe the discovery mechanism with any input.
Bitcoin-based clients. Here peer discovery is done with a getAddress message which takes no
input. The peer returns with up to 1000 nodes sampled from the two peer tables ramdomly (biased
by the size of the tables and the freshness of information), this response is cached per IP for 24hrs
so that multiple getAddress messages return the same value [10].
DHT-based clients. The original Kademlia protocol defines four messages of which the FIND_NODE
message facilitates peer discovery [58]. With this request a peer can query any compatible network
participant to obtain a list of peers from its routing table that are closest in terms of XOR distance
to a specified key. The specific contents of the message varies by implementation. In the discv4
protocol, the query contains the target key of which the requestor wants to get the closest peers
known to the remote. The same is true for the libp2p protocol. In the discv5 protocol, the requestor
calculates the distance of the remote to the target key and transmits the distance value as part
of the FIND_NODE message. Each of these implementations returns a fixed number of peers per
response: 16 in discv4 and discv5, and 20 in libp2p. By carefully crafting these FIND_NODE messages
it is possible to fetch the entire contents of a remote’s peer table.
Others. The other protocols considered in this study have similar discovery mechanisms. The
peer discovery protocol of Ripple uses a discovery message with no input. The peer responds with
a small sample (typically 10-20 nodes) which is first filled by the node’s own peers and then drawn
from the cache (node information includes a counter which signals if the peer is actively connected
to the node) [89]. Avalanche has a discovery mechanism with a mix of push and pull, where you
periodically advertise a peer list (default size of 50) made up of first the nodes you are connected
to, and the rest of the space with nodes from your discovered cache [6]. Both of these protocols

Fig. 1. Overview of our crawling and connectivity measurement pipeline. (1) Crawlers: For Bitcoin-based,
RPC-based, and API-based networks, we query peers for their known peers using messages such as getaddr
or getPeers, collecting peer tables daily. For DHT-based protocols, we issue FINDNODE requests hourly to
exhaustively enumerate remote routing tables. (2) Connectivity checks: Discovered peers are further probed
using a TCP-level connectivity check, as well as a protocol-specific PING message where it exists. Otherwise,
the peer discovery mechanism serves as ping (crawl PING). (3) IP scanning: For networks lacking peer
discovery mechanisms (e.g., Cardano), we perform one-time Internet-wide scans using protocol-specific
handshake payloads to identify responsive nodes. Together, these components enable comprehensive and
continuous measurement of peer-to-peer blockchain networks across diverse discovery mechanisms.
prioritize sharing information about their active connections. The Near discovery protocol similarly
gives information about active connections, where in fact the request contains two fields max_peers
which is how many peers to respond with (up to 50) and max_direct_peers which is how many
responses should be from active connections, from these they chosen randomly [62]. Stellar, on the
other hand, has a peer discovery mechanism which returns a default 50 peers randomly sampled
from their peer table [81].
2.3
Other details
Bootstrapping. When a node first joins the network, they may already know about some nodes in
the network and first establish a connection to them. Otherwise, a node utilized some bootstrapping
mechanism to learn about some initial nodes in the network such as some hardcoded nodes in the
client or DNS-like servers. In [52], the authors provide a survey of bootstrapping approaches used
by several blockchain protocols.
Self Announcements. In some networks, nodes periodically gossip an announcement of themselves
so that other nodes may add them to their peer tables. In Bitcoin-based clients, a node does this
via unsolicited addr messages containing their own IP [11]. In Ethereum’s discv4 protocol, the
FINDNODE message with the sender’s own public ID works also as a self announcement as it initiates
the receiver adding the node to their own table if there is space (i.e., the corresponding bucket is
empty or has a non-responding entry).
3
Crawler Methodology
To gather data from a network we primarily utilize the peer discovery mechanism of the network.
At a high-level we want to gather the sum of all peer tables, and further distinguish those nodes
that are actually online and reachable (we can establish some form of connection to, i.e., are not
behind a NAT or firewall). To do this, there are two parts to our data collection: the crawler and the
connectivity checker. Figure 1 summarizes our methodology.

Lucianna Kiffer, Lioba Heimbach, Dennis Trautwein, Yann Vonlanthen, and Oliver Gasser
Crawler. We begin with an initial set of nodes we know about,2 and add them to our queue of
nodes to query. A node is then popped from this queue, and a crawl query (typically one or more
peer discovery messages) is sent to it. Any new peers learned from the responses are added to
the queue if they have not been seen before. This continues until the queue is empty, meaning all
nodes have been queried. These requests are executed in parallel, and all responses, along with the
peers they originated from, are logged.
Connectivity Checker. We use several metrics for connectivity checks. One method is to take
nodes that responded to our crawl messages. Since a node may be online but not necessarily respond
to the crawler for various reasons (e.g., some crawl messages require initiating a peer connection),
we use other metrics to establish if a node may be active. One approach is to use in-protocol PING
or similar light-weight messages (e.g., a status message) to verify a client is running at the given IP.
We also utilize TCP PINGs to test for port-specific activity — many protocols run on non-standard
ports which shouldn’t otherwise be open. Since we have various forms of connectivity checks (full
crawls, in-protocol PING, TCP PING) to be as inclusive as possible, we generally consider a node
"active" if it responds to any of these.3 In Table 2 we show the breakdown of number of nodes that
are discovered per crawler and subsequently respond to any of the connection attempts done for
that network.
We now describe the specific messages and approaches used for each network for the crawl and
connectivity checker.
3.1
Bitcoin-based networks
Crawler. We build a crawler based on the Bitcoin Core client [9] which is the reference imple-
mentation of Bitcoin based in C++. We use the getAddress message which includes the protocol
version and network secret corresponding to each network. Thus to crawl any network running
off of a Bitcoin client code fork, all we need is the network secret and initial nodes to bootstrap the
crawler. The network secret for Bitcoin is 0xd9b4bef9, for Dogecoin it is 0xc0c0c0c0, for Bitcoin
Cash it is 0xe8f3e1e34, and for Litecoin it is 0xdbb6c0fb. We attempt each connection up to 10
times with a timeout of 20 seconds, and run the connections concurrently. We also send a version
message to each discovered node which they respond with protocol-specific details such as the
version of the protocoland the client they are running.
Connectivity. Of the nodes discovered that day, we then run hourly connectivity checks which
includes an in-protocol PING and a TCP PING. We ping each IPv4 and IPv6 IP address on the port
of the address we learned about and on the default port(s) of the protocol (8333 for Bitcoin and
Bitcoin Cash (*), 22556 for Dogecoin, and 9333 for Litecoin).
3.2
DHT-based networks
Crawler. We have built a generic Kademlia-DHT crawler based on the Golang discv4 [33],
discv5 [34], and libp2p [72] implementations which was initially employed in [86]. We use the
aforementioned FIND_NODE message with carefully crafted payloads to fetch the contents of a
2For the first crawl, we use hard-coded boostrap nodes, and for subsequent crawls we use a small subset of the nodes we
learned about in the previous crawl.
3Because our methodology is entirely active — we initiate all connections — nodes behind NATs or firewalls that do not
accept inbound connections are not captured in our active set; thus, our active counts represent a lower bound on true
network size. Previous work has estimated the size of “unreachable” nodes in the Bitcoin network as twice the reachable
count [40, 87].
4Bitcoin SV and eCash use the same network secret as Bitcoin Cash, and thus effectively run over the same peer discovery
network. We therefore refer to the data collected here as BitcoinCash (*) and in Section 5.2.1 breakdown the data
into the sub-networks based on the version and client information.

remote peers’ individual 𝑘-buckets. In the discv4 protocol, the query must be constructed such that
the target key, when Keccak256-hashed, falls into a target bucket. Similarly, libp2p requires the pre-
image to be crafted such that its SHA-256 hash maps to a specific bucket in a remote peers’ routing
table. In contrast, discv5 allows the requester to directly specify the target distance in the FIND_NODE
request. discv5 and libp2p can span different DHT networks as they have a notion of a protocol ID.
Only peers advertising the same protocol ID participate in the same DHT network. discv4 does not
have such a concept. One such protocol ID in libp2p is, e.g., /celestia/celestia/kad/1.0.0 for
the Celestia network and 0x646973637635 in discv5 (reads discv5 in ASCII). Upon a successful
connection our crawler performs protocol-specific handshakes to extract additional information
about the remote peer. In libp2p it’s the identify exchange and in discv5 it’s the request for the
latest Ethereum Node Record (ENR). This gives us information about, e.g., the software version
that the remote peer is running, other supported protocols, or, in the case of discv4 and discv5,
which network fork the remote peer follows.
Connectivity. We run a full crawl every two hours for all the studied DHT networks. We tally TCP
PINGs if the crawler was able to successfully establish a TCP or QUIC connection to the remote
peer. If we further were able to perform the full handshake we label this as a crawl PING.
3.3
RPC-based networks
Some protocols have built-in Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) where in the node responds with their
full current list of active connections. These have the disadvantage that we don’t learn about the
discovery mechanism of the protocol, but we get exactly the active nodes with much less complexity
than setting up a custom discovery messages-based crawler. Both Ripple, Avalanche, and Near
expose such functionality.
Ripple. For daily crawl, we take advantage of a built-in crawler RPC [88] in which a node returns
all their active connections.5 We send an HTTPS based request with https://{address}:{port}/crawl
starting with the r.ripple.com boot service, and then for each IP we learn about we query it on
default ports 2459 (IANA assigned) and 51235 (legacy). For connectivity checks, we send a health
RPC message and a TCP PING.
Avalanche. Clients have a built-in RPC request info.peers [4] where nodes return all their
current active connections. The response includes client version for itself and its peers, the node
ID, and some other protocol information (e.g., subnets). The node information includes both an “IP”
and “public IP” which may have different ports, we use the latter. We then run hourly TCP PINGs
at the given port and default ports 9650 and 9651.
Near. Clients have an RPC call network_info which a node returns all of their active peers (just
IP and node ID) [63], we run this hourly. Additionally, for the connectivity check, we use a status
message and a TCP PING hourly at the given port and default ports 3030 and 24567.
3.4
Other networks
Stellar. We adapted the Javascript-based Stellarbeat crawler [82]. It uses the discovery messages to
enumerate over all discovered peers and ask them for peers, recording one response per node (with
some peer information such as if they are a validator). We run this hourly and record responsive
nodes as a crawl PING, plus an hourly TCP PING at the given port and default port 11625.
5Except those that are specifically private connections, which is a flag a peer can request you set.

a We scrape both explorers; Blockchair only provides IPv4 nodes, while Bitnodes includes IPv6 and Tor.
b ethernodes.org historically provided discovered IPs, but since March 2025 shows only aggregate counts.
c Their API used to expose IPs for non-validator nodes; as of mid-May 2025 it no longer does.
Table 1. Networks we measure individually, ordered by their market capitalization at the start of our measure-
ments (December 24, 2024). Cardano is the one network in the list for which we do not run daily measurements,
but instead measure via two IP scans. All others we run daily crawler and connectivity checks.
Solana. Since Solana does not have a traditional peer discovery mechanism, we do not implement
our own crawler but instead rely on data from the Sola Beach node explorer [78]. At the start of
our measurement period, their API had a /v1/non-validators which returned the IPs (and some
protocol-specific information like version and features) of the RPC nodes of the network. We pulled
this data hourly and send a TCP PING to the IPs we learned about at the given port and default
ports 8000 and 8001. We note that this API call stopped returning IP-level information in mid May
2025.
Cardano. Currently, Cardano does not offer a distributed peer discovery mechanism and instead
relies on a network of trusted nodes for bootstrapping. In addition, the network consists of different
types of nodes (block-producing nodes and relays [36]), which makes it difficult to measure its size.
Therefore, we rely on IP scans, as described in Section 5.4. The scan results are validated through
an API maintained by the Cardano foundation [17].

Data Collection
In Table 1 we summarize the networks for which we collect data, sorted by their market caps taken
on December 24, 2024. We note that Avalanche was number 9 by market cap at the time. We thus
have some level of coverage for 8 out of the top 10 protocols by market cap at the time (Binance
was number 5, which we cover in our discv4 breakdown in Section 5.2.2 and Figure 4). Overall, we
cover 14 out of the top 21 protocols by market cap (all those above $5B) and 21 others from the
shared nature of several discovery protocols (we list these individually by their respective discovery
protocols in Section 5.2). This makes up the single most extensive coverage of the P2P networks of
existing blockchain systems.6

4.1
Logistics
We run all data collection on AWS in Virginia (us-east-1). The DHT measurements were done
every two hours using AWS Fargate serverless compute engines. Depending on the network being
crawled the resource configurations differ and range from 1vCPU/2GB in the case of Celestia to
8vCPU/16GB for Ethereum discv4. All other crawlers and connectivity checks ran on a 4vCPU/16GB
EC2 machine with the Bitcoin-based crawler starting 5 minutes after midnight UTC with each
protocol crawled sequentially. All other crawls were similarly run sequentially, starting at 01:30
(giving the Bitcoin crawlers plenty of time to finish). The connectivity checkers for these protocols
were run hourly starting at 03:00 to 23:00, with the Bitcoin-client checks at the start of the hour,
and the others at quarter past. Protocols with hourly crawls were run at this time as well. The node
explorer scrapers ran hourly, on their own light 1vCPU/1GB machine.
We note that running all measurements from a single geographic location introduces poten-
tial biases. Some nodes may apply IP-based rate limiting, filtering, or blocklists targeting cloud
provider ranges such as AWS, which could prevent successful handshakes or skew connectivity
measurements. Latency between our vantage point and remote peers may also cause occasional
timeouts; however, we mitigate this to some extent by considering a node “active” if it responds to
any of our hourly checks within a day. Despite this, geographic and provider-based effects remain
a limitation and may lead us to undercount certain regions or network segments.
4.2
Scraping node explorers
In Table 1, we also summarize the networks for which there exists a node explorer (a website that
lists information about the nodes running in a network, often run by third parties). More commonly,
these websites list general network statistics, such as size and geographic distribution. Some of
these explorers explicitly expose the IP addresses of the nodes, most commonly as a snapshot in
time (i.e., the current set of nodes in the network with no historical information). Thus, we gather
these snapshots over time by scraping the website for the full set of nodes currently active (or
calling the API if one exists), and do so on an hourly basis to achieve coverage similar to our crawler
collection.
For Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, we use the Blockchair [13] API, which provides
a list of IP:port, version, and country-level information. Notably, Blockchair only provides IPv4 data
even though all these networks support IPv6. For Bitcoin, we additionally scrape Bitnodes [12],
which provides IPv4, IPv6, and Onion addresses for nodes operating over Tor. Bitnodes provides
similar information, along with details on how long they have been connected to the node. For the
Ethereum execution network, we were scraping Ethernodes [35], which used to provide a list of
IP:port, node ID, and client information, as well as the time of last connection. We scraped this
information hourly and took nodes whose last connection was from the same date. For Ethereum
Classic, we scrape ETCnodes [32] hourly, which provides similarly IP:port, node ID, version
information, and we filter for nodes whose last seen data was on the same day. Lastly, for Stellar,
we use the API call from OBSRVR Radar [66] to query snapshot data for historical information (all
days of our study) and within a snapshot filter for nodes seen that day.
4.3
Internet-wide scanning
In addition to crawling the cryptocurrency networks, we also perform active measurements to
characterize cryptocurrency networks through an additional lens. We use ZMap [30] to perform
port scans and then leverage ZGrab2 [93]. For IPv4, we perform Internet-wide measurements,
whereas for IPv6 — due to its expansive address space — we rely on the IPv6 Hitlist [38] to obtain
likely responsive addresses. We perform these scans from an AWS machine and follow Internet

and limiting our scanning rate to 50kpps.
We run active measurement scans for three of the Bitcoin-based networks (Bitcoin, Dogecoin,
and Bitcoin Cash), and compare the results with ground truth crawling data we collect. Additionally,
we run two scans of the Cardano network — a network we do not crawl — and compare our results
with network statistics from the Cardano Foundation. We explain our payload and present the
results of this scan in Section 5.4.

Mapping the Landscape: Measuring Peer-to-Peer Blockchain Networks
In this section, we describe the diverse set of measurement techniques we deploy to estimate network
sizes across 36 blockchain networks. These include active crawlers, decomposing measurements of
networks that share a discovery layer, Internet-wide scanning, and comparisons with public node
explorers. We synthesize their results into a unified estimate of network sizes.
5.1
Crawler measurements
We begin our analysis by presenting an overview of the crawled networks and their temporal
evolution. Figure 2 highlights the wide variation in network scale. Ethereum (discv4) and Ethereum
(discv5) consistently register over 20,000 active nodes, with Ethereum (discv4) exceeding 30,000 at
its peak,7 while Bitcoin and Polkadot remain in the same order of magnitude. Avalanche, Solana,
and Avail sustain a few thousand peers, whereas Litecoin, Stellar, Near, Ripple, Dogecoin, Bitcoin
Cash (*), Filecoin, and Celestia operate at only a few hundred. Despite these differences, node
counts remain remarkably stable over the eight-month measurement window.
Table 2 reports median daily node metrics across all crawls, where “active IPs” denotes peers
that replied to our liveness probes and “discovered IPs” denotes the total addresses observed in
the discovery phase. First, the discovery-hit ratio (active/discovered) varies dramatically. Polkadot,
Filecoin, Celestia, and Avail all exhibit ratios near unity, indicating that almost every discovered
7The large disparity of numbers between the two Ethereum networks is due to their discovery layers encapsulating many
other networks, particularly discv4 as we show in Section 5.2.

Table 2. Median daily node metrics for each blockchain: active, discovered node counts, the discovery-hit
ratio (active/discovered), and median proportions of nodes by network attributes (ISP vs. hosting), IP version
(IPv4 vs. IPv6), and liveness checks via TCP, protocol, and crawl pings.
peer responds to probes. Thus, nodes in these networks appear to overwhelmingly have active
peers in their tables. By contrast, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin show ratios below
0.05, reflecting large numbers of nonresponsive addresses. Ethereum (discv4) and Ethereum (discv5)
fall in between, with ratios of 0.58 and 0.28, respectively.
Next, we examine hosting versus ISP deployment. Ripple, Solana, Stellar, and Near have hosting-
provider proportions above 0.90, consistent with residential nodes being rare — especially on
resource-intensive chains like Solana. Bitcoin nodes show the highest ISP share at 0.45, while most
other networks lie between 0.10 and 0.40. Further, IPv6 adoption remains limited. Bitcoin-based
networks lead with roughly 15–20% using IPv6, whereas most chains rely almost entirely on IPv4;
notable exceptions are Polkadot (0.20) and Celestia (0.16).
Finally, liveness-check success varies markedly by probe type. TCP-level pings achieve median
success rates above 0.80 for most networks; notable exceptions are several DHT-based networks:
Polkadot (0.19), Ethereum (discv4) (0.66), Ethereum (discv5) (0.62), and Avail (0.18). Each blockchain
is probed at a higher level via either protocol or crawl pings. Bitcoin client–based crawlers employ
protocol pings, yielding median response rates above 0.80. Nebula DHT–based crawlers use crawl
pings, which succeed at median rates above 0.90 for Ethereum (discv4), Ethereum (discv5), Polkadot,
Filecoin, Celestia, and Avail. In general, Bitcoin-based networks were more likely to respond to
TCP pings while DHT-based networks were more likely to respond to crawl pings.
5.2
Multi-network discovery protocols
While many blockchain networks operate isolated peer discovery mechanisms, others share a
common discovery layer across multiple logical protocols or chains. In such cases, a single discovery
network may simultaneously serve multiple sub-protocols, forks, or application-layer overlays.
This multiplexing complicates network measurement and attribution, as the discovery layer does
not always explicitly reveal which protocol a peer belongs to. In this section, we examine three such
discovery networks, Bitcoin Cash (*), and Ethereum’s discv4 and discv5 discovery mechanisms,
and decompose them into their distinct protocols where possible. Beyond these shared discovery
networks, we also quantify IP-level overlap across all 14 measured discovery mechanisms to capture
cross-network participation in Appendix E.
5.2.1

to differentiate networks (including testnets) as an early check if two nodes follow the same

fork since November 2018 – and Bitcoin SV – actually a fork of Bitcoin Cash since July 2019 –
shared the same MAGIC string. This means that at the discovery layer, they act as one network, not
differentiating until further down in the peering handshake. Thus, they store each other’s IPs in
their peer tables. To differentiate them, we look at the version message, specifically which client a
node runs. Through this analysis, we also found a third protocol eCash – another Bitcoin Cash
fork since November 2020 [53] – with its own client. Figure 3 shows the breakdown across the
three main networks and the IPs unresponsive to the version message (i.e., the "none" category).
For each IP, on a given day, we check version responses up to a week before and after to increase
our labeling. Given its market cap, Bitcoin SV makes up a small fraction of our labeling.
5.2.2
Ethereum networks. Ethereum uses two generations of node discovery protocols, discv4 and
discv5, which serve as the foundation for many Ethereum-based networks to find and connect
to peers. Unlike Bitcoin-style forks, where blockchains split at the consensus level, Ethereum’s
discovery layer acts more like a shared substrate: multiple networks (even those not related to the
Ethereum ecosystem) may use the same discovery graph to bootstrap connectivity, even if they do
not interoperate at higher layers.
Recall that in discv4, nodes are identified by a public key (called the enode) which does not give
any protocol-level information. For this, we initiate a protocol handshake with all nodes we learn
about. This handshake provides three fields which we can use to identify a network: fork id (a
protocol-specific hex, specific to the unique version (or fork) of the protocol), chain id (a number
to signify the network9) and client (mostly unique for protocols running non-Ethereum clients
such as the bor client for the Polygon network [84]). We label networks first by fork id, then by
chain id if it is unique, and lastly by client (again by uniqueness, then a “Misc Client” field for all
Ethereum-based clients with no fork id or chain id given). Figure 4 summarizes our labeling with
the top protocols and their market caps. As with Bitcoin Cash, we take all unlabeled IPs (from
the “none” category — meaning no information is given) and look at a window of one week to
see if it can inherit a label from a different day. We also take discv5 Ethereum-labeled IPs and
cross-reference them with the “none” IPs; these are labeled “Ethereum(from discv5)”. This decreases
the none category by more than half. This implies a difficulty for us to execute the full protocol
9Some are unique to the protocol but others like 1 is used by the Ethereum mainnet and several other networks. A breakdown
of chain ids can be found in [21].

For discv5, nodes have ENRs, which encode several protocol-level information with, most impor-
tantly for us, the fork digest, which encodes both the genesis block data10 and the current protocol
version. We can use this exclusively to differentiate the Ethereum mainnet (which underwent a
protocol upgrade during our measurement study from the Deneb fork to Electra), its testnets, and,
interestingly, the Gnosis protocol (also present in discv4). We have a small “other” category with

fork digests associated with unknown protocols (possible private networks), and still a large “none”
for IPs, which gave no ENR information. Again, we take any labelling within a window of one
week, but given the encoded information in the ENR, this does not noticeably decrease the number
of unlabeled IPs, and cross-referencing the discv4 labeling for Ethereum gives us only a handful of
additional labels.
5.3
Comparison with node explorers
Finally, we compare our network size measurements to those of node explorers where possible.
Figure 6 contrasts our crawler-derived active-IP counts (solid lines) with public explorer data (dotted
and dashed lines). For Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, Blockchair’s figures track our measurements
closely but remain slightly lower (we attribute this to the missing 10% of IPv6). Bitnodes reports a
markedly smaller Bitcoin network than Blockchair and our measurements. In the case of Bitcoin
Cash, Blockchair overestimates active peers by about twofold, likely because it does not differentiate
between the multiple blockchains using the same discovery protocol (cf. Section 5.2.1).
Moving to two blockchains using the Ethereum (disv4) protocol, Ethernodes significantly un-
derestimates node counts versus our crawler (likely because of the missing discv5 information
cf. Section 5.2.2), whereas Etcnodes’ estimate for Ethereum Classic slightly exceeds ours. Stellar
stands out for its near-perfect alignment between explorer and crawler counts, likely because they
also utilize the Stellar Beat crawler implementation [82]. Most of these explorers don’t provide
methodology, so we can only speculate about the discrepancies, but they underscore how differing
measurement methods affect reported network sizes.
5.4
Internet-wide scanning
Many blockchains use their own client software, so we often had to write new code to handle
their specific peer discovery and handshake behavior. To reduce effort and as a potential general

solution to gathering network measurements across ecosystems, we explored Internet-wide scans.
Here, we probe all IP addresses in the IPv4 space and all addresses present on the IPv6 hitlist [38],
initiating a TCP connection at a specific port (e.g., the default port of the protocol) and by using a
network-specific payload (e.g., the first exchange of the peering handshake). While the payload
does require some technical understanding of the protocol, it is significantly simpler than setting
up an entire crawler.
To test the efficacy of Internet-wide scanning on capturing actual network participants, we first
scan three of the Bitcoin-client based networks (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash (*)) that we
have ground truth data for from our crawls. We additionally scan the Cardano network, the 8th
largest by market cap as of December 2024, for which we do not have a working crawler and
present the results below.
5.4.1
Bitcoin clients IP scan. For the Bitcoin clients, we use the VERSION message with the network-
specific MAGIC string. We verify that only clients with the same MAGIC string respond to our request;
otherwise, the connection attempt times out. We consider primarily the default port for scanning.
Table 3 shows the port breakdown of the IPv4 active clients in these three networks during this
measurement period. We confirm that the default ports are the most widely used. For each network,
we scan the associated port with the associated payload. For Dogecoin, we also scan one additional
port (19919), and for Bitcoin Cash (*) we scan two additional ports (8344 and 8433), to get more
coverage since the default ports have slightly lower use.
We ran the scans consecutively from July 9 to 14, 2025. We take the crawl data for these networks
from the day(s) of the scan of the protocol, plus a two-day window (e.g., the Bitcoin scan ran on July
8, so we take crawl data from July 6 to 10) to compare. Table 4 summarizes our Bitcoin-based results
with the number of successful connections we get, those that respond with some payload, and
what was in the payload. For most protocols, we see a large fraction of HTTP 400 error messages,
which hints at contacting an HTTP server running on a non-standard port. We check if the payload
corresponds to a correct Bitcoin version message and specifically the correct version of the network
(Version_x in the table). Of these, we take the intersection with the discovered and active nodes
from our crawler data.
We see that the IP addresses we find in scans consistently show up in our active data set, which
is expected, as they are reachable. From Table 3, we would expect to learn about 10K IPs in the
Bitcoin scan, and we do get about 90% of this number. There is less overlap with our crawl data,
which could be due to the random sampling nature of Bitcoin’s discovery protocol, or the 5% daily
churn we observed in the data (cf. Section 6.1.1). Dogecoin sees a similar percentage of coverage,
and the version message is able to distinguish well the nodes actually in the Dogecoin network
(the majority of nodes that respond with a version that is not Dogecoin’s are nodes with Bitcoin’s
version number). Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, uses the same version number as Bitcoin, so
its scan responses are much more polluted with Bitcoin data. It is interesting that because these
scan payloads used the network-specific MAGIC string, most of the Bitcoin nodes do not respond
to the Bitcoin Cash (*) payload. A final note is that less than 5% of the version-specific responses
were from IPv6 addresses (216 for Bitcoin, 12 for Dogecoin, and 14 for Bitcoin Cash (*)). The above
results suggest Internet-wide scans do give a good estimate of the network size when a
protocol has a unique payload and response.
5.4.2
Cardano IP scan. Since Cardano relies on a network of trusted nodes for bootstrapping [44]
and consists of multiple types of nodes [36], we measure the size of its network solely through IP
scans. Cardano’s networking layer consists of multiple mini-protocols. The handshake protocol is
used to negotiate the protocol version and the protocol parameters when connecting to a node,
and consists of a single request and a single reply encoded in CBOR [19].

Table 5. IP scan results for Cardano. The first column shows the number of unique IP addresses to which we
successfully connected on either port 3001, 3001, 3002, 6000, or 60001. Further columns show the subset of IP
addresses from which we received a response, those that were HTTP 400 error, a valid response (correctly
formatted CBOR), a successful handshake (code = 1), and that support the newest protocol version (version
14). The last column shows the average number of nodes returned by the API over the time of the IP scans.
Based on existing client implementations, we craft a valid handshake request that requests
establishing a connection using all available protocol versions. We scan the five most commonly
used ports, according to the ports advertised in the only public registry we could find (ports 3000,
3001, 3002, 6000, and 6001) [49]. Together, these ports make up 75% of all advertised ports by relays.
Each port is scanned sequentially and scans last up to 6 days.
Table 5 shows how many responses we collect. As these ports are shared with multiple other
protocols and applications, the vast majority of responses are not valid handshake responses. The
valid responses further consist of msgRefuse (code=2) or msgProposeVersions (code=0) [23]. We
consider only handshake successes (msgAcceptVersion, code=1). The vast majority of successful
handshake responses accept the latest protocol version (version 14). We validate these results using
the Cardano Foundation API [17], which posts aggregate statistics on network size. We compare our
results with the average network size over the days of the scans. These numbers are slightly lower
than our measurements, which can be explained because our scans cannot distinguish testnets or
private networks, and the scan collects data over multiple days, which could aggregate some churn.

Network size summary
Given our crawls, scans, and breakdown of discovery protocols, we can finally summarize our
findings. We display the median network sizes for all crawled blockchains together with their
economic scale in Figure 7. The analysis underscores the extreme heterogeneity of blockchain
network footprints: median peer counts span more than three orders of magnitude, from
over 10,000 in the largest networks down to fewer than 10 in the smallest. We also relate

network size to market capitalization (right y-axis), expressing node density as active peers per
US$ billion. While market capitalization is an imperfect baseline as it omits measures such as
TVL or on-chain activity, it provides a coarse economic reference. The comparison shows no
linear relationship between capitalization and network size but reveals pronounced differences
across ecosystems: several small-cap networks maintain relatively dense infrastructures, whereas
high-value systems operate with far fewer nodes per unit of capitalization.

Beyond Size: Structural Properties and Decentralization
With network size baselines in place, we now turn to a broader analysis of structural and operational
properties that influence decentralization and resilience. We explore temporal dynamics (churn,
uptime), geographic and network-layer concentration, peer table characteristics, and inter-network
relationships (cf. Appendix E for full overlap matrices across all networks). We focus primarily
on the daily data gathered through the 15 discovery network crawlers in this section. Although
the metrics vary by design and maturity of each protocol, together they provide insight into the
centralization risks and operational diversity present across blockchain P2P ecosystems.
6.1
Temporal dynamics
6.1.1
Daily churn. We begin by examining churn via daily node-retention rates, defined as the
percentage of nodes active on day 𝑡−1 that remain active on day 𝑡. Figure 8 presents the full
distribution of these rates for all 15 blockchains, with medians and inner quartiles indicated.
All networks sustain high retention: every chain has median rates above 90%. The lowest medians
appear in the Bitcoin-based networks, Dogecoin and Litecoin, which fall below 95%. In contrast,
smaller networks such as Ripple, Avalanche, Stellar, Near, and Celestia achieve medians above
98%. Notably, the upper tails of several distributions (e.g., Bitcoin and Litecoin) cut off well below
100%, revealing a baseline level of daily churn that may result from some nodes rotating their IPs.
Weekly retention rates, where churn compounds over multiple days, are shown in Figure 14 in
Appendix B. We also examine churn from the opposite perspective by considering daily new-IP
rates in Figure 13 in Appendix B. Several networks show a nonzero lower bound in their new-IP
distributions. Bitcoin and Litecoin never fall below roughly 2%, suggesting a steady influx of fresh

IPs from address rotation or dynamic hosting. In contrast, networks like Ripple, Avalanche, Near,
Celestia, and Avail have median new-IP rates below 2%, indicating highly stable peer sets.
Finally, we examine multi-day persistence by plotting the cumulative distribution of node uptime
streaks for the two-week window from April 5–20, 2025 (Figure 9). Each curve shows the fraction
of nodes whose observed consecutive-day uptime does not exceed 𝑥days. Smaller chains such as
Near and Avalanche display the highest persistence, with the majority of peers active for all 16 days.
By contrast, larger or Bitcoin-based networks — Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum (discv5)
— have fewer than 50% of nodes sustaining uninterrupted operation over the full period. These
results demonstrate that even modest daily churn (see Figure 8) compounds over time, yielding
substantial turnover across multi-day intervals.
6.2
Geographic and AS distribution
6.2.1
Geographic distribution. We next examine the geographic distribution of active IPs across all
blockchains with IP mappings given by IPInfo [46]. Figure 10 shows the daily share of IPs in the
nine countries with the highest node counts (United States, Germany, France, Netherlands, United
Kingdom, Switzerland, Poland, China, and Canada), with all other countries grouped as “Other”. The
combined share of the United States and Germany remains above 50% throughout the measurement
period, and the top nine countries account for over 80% of all active IPs, indicating pronounced
geographic centralization. Although these figures aggregate across all networks, Appendix C
provides the country breakdown for each individual chain. In most cases, the United States and
Germany host the largest fractions of peers. Notable exceptions include Polkadot, where China
holds the second largest share, and Filecoin, in which China contributes the largest share of IPs.
Further detail is provided in Table 6, which breaks down each network’s median share of active
IPs by continent alongside the overall averages. Overall, Europe and North America dominate,
accounting for 41.2% and 46.5% of IPs respectively, with Asia contributing another 10.4%. Three
networks – Polkadot, Filecoin, and Avail – stand out with over 20% of peers in Asia, and Filecoin
approaches 60% Asian presence. Solana and Avail also exceed the global average of 0.3% for Africa,
each with more than 1.5% of nodes on the continent. Aside from Solana (29.8% Europe) and Filecoin
(19.3% Europe and 19.3% in North America), every network places at least 30% of its IPs each in

𝑠𝑗= number of active nodes in AS 𝑗

is the share of active nodes in AS 𝑗. For each day 𝑡, we compute the daily HHIAS by summing
the squared shares 𝑠2
𝑗. An HHIAS near 1/𝑀indicates low concentration (nodes evenly distributed
across ASes), whereas values approaching 1 indicate high concentration in a few ASes.
Figure 11 plots the daily HHI of AS-level concentration for each of the 15 networks. Several chains
exhibit markedly higher concentration, including Near, Avalanche, Ripple, Solana, and Stellar. These
networks either have relatively small networks (Near, Ripple, Stellar) or rely heavily on data-center
deployments to meet high resource requirements (Solana), resulting in most peers residing in a
handful of ASes. Avalanche stands out in the plot, having experienced a large fluctuation of its HHI,
matching a general large fluctuation of network participants during the first couple of months of
our study.
By contrast, Filecoin, Bitcoin, Celestia, Avail, and Polkadot consistently rank among the least
concentrated. Bitcoin and Polkadot have large networks, while Avail and Celestia already showed
low geographic centralization, and Filecoin’s limited use of large hosting providers further reduces
its AS HHI.
6.3
Peer table analysis
Until now, we have largely focused our analysis on the active network. We end our analysis by
diving deeper into the peer tables to gain an understanding of how much of the network nodes in
the network know about and what proportion of peers they tell us about is active. Recall that we
do not collect peer tables with our Solana measurements, so it is omitted from this section. Table 7
summarizes four key peer-table metrics for each blockchain: the median table size, the median
count of peers in each table that respond to liveness probes, the proportion of table entries that are
active peers, and the fraction of the overall active network covered by the median table.

Table 7. Summary of median peer-table metrics for each blockchain: median table size; median count of
active peers per table; fraction of peers in each table that are active; and the share of the active network
covered by the median table.
First, table sizes vary by more than an order of magnitude. Avalanche returns the largest tables
(median size = 1349 peers), which is distinctly surprising since the data we collect for Avalanche is
their active connections. The Bitcoin-based protocols by default return up to 1k peers, which are
generally below this – Bitcoin (864) and Bitcoin Cash(*) (744), and Dogecoin (718). At the other
extreme, Ripple returns only 19 peers on average, with Near (34), which makes sense since the data
we collect is their active connections. Stellar (50) and Filecoin (97) also return fewer.
Next, we see stark differences in peer responsiveness. Ethereum (discv4) and Ethereum (discv5)
achieve over 93% active peers in their tables, as do Polkadot (92%), Filecoin (95%), Celestia (89%), and
Avail (92%), reflecting highly well-maintained peer lists in these DHT-based networks. In contrast,
the Bitcoin-based networks have few active peers in their tables. To be precise, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash
(*), and Litecoin tables have fewer than 5% active entries, possibly due to a previously measured

Fig. 12. Greedy coverage of active IPs across discovery networks on April 10, 2025. Each curve shows the
cumulative percentage of active IPs covered as additional peer tables are greedily unioned, ordered to maximize

2/3 of the Bitcoin network being behind NATs [40]. Though Ripple, Avalanche, and Stellar nodes
return their active connections, the low response rate of those connections to our crawls (less than
30% in any network) makes it challenging to extrapolate meaningful topological properties of these
networks. For the other networks, it is difficult (by design) to infer active connections from peer
table data, as not all active connections are stored in the peer table, and peer tables often have
many more nodes than connections. Further analysis is left for future work.
Finally, table coverage of the full network ranges from under 1% for both Ethereum networks
(0.4% and 0.7%) up to over 50% for Avalanche, whose median table alone sees more than half of all
active peers. Dogecoin (39%) and Celestia (38%) also achieve substantial coverage, whereas most
other networks cover below 10% of their active nodes with a single crawl response.
We further assess peer-table coverage using a greedy union algorithm on April 10, 2025 (Figure 12).
Each curve traces the cumulative share of active IPs reached as additional peer tables are added in
order of maximal marginal gain. Avalanche’s first table already discovers over 75% of active IPs,
and just four tables are required to cover the entire network. A single table from Ripple, Dogecoin
or Celestia also suffices to reach at least 50% of active IPs. In contrast, larger networks demand far
more tables to get to all active IPs: Bitcoin needs 1,278 peer lists to cover all active nodes, Ethereum
(discv4) requires 640 lists, Ethereum (discv5) 623 lists, and Polkadot 380 lists. Further, a single peer
list for each of these networks does not suffice to reach 10% of the active network.

Concluding Discussion
Our findings reveal a surprising gap between the economic weight of many blockchain ecosystems
and the size and transparency of the P2P networks that sustain them. Some networks supporting
millions—or even billions—of dollars in value are maintained by only a few dozen publicly reachable
nodes. This fragility has real security implications: small or centralized networks may be easier
to partition, censor, or disrupt. Furthermore, many users and developers remain unaware of the
actual state of the networks they rely on. For several systems, especially those lacking public node
explorers, there is no simple way to even approximate network size or health. This lack of visibility


Multiple Sides of 36 Coins: Measuring Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure Across Cryptocurrencies
23
undermines trust and makes it difficult to assess the decentralization or resilience that these systems
often claim to embody.
Our measurement effort also underscores just how difficult it is to observe blockchain P2P
infrastructure at scale. Each network tends to implement its own custom discovery logic, often with
sparse or outdated documentation and code written in disparate languages. Even for this study,
which covers a representative set of major cryptocurrencies by market cap, we required more than
a dozen custom-built crawlers and extensive protocol analysis. In some cases, default port scanning
offered a scalable alternative, but only when protocol signatures were consistent and predictable.
Importantly, because our methodology is entirely active, we only capture nodes that are publicly
reachable; peers behind NATs or firewalls are not reflected in our “active” counts, which therefore
represent a lower bound on true network size. Passive measurements could complement this view,
but would require running full nodes across multiple networks, which is substantially more resource-
intensive. Developers could further improve transparency by including basic protocol metadata
earlier in the handshake, adopting network-unique identifiers (e.g., MAGIC bytes), documenting
peer table maintenance strategies, and building public-facing measurement tools. Notably, many
node explorers today are maintained by independent third parties rather than protocol developers
themselves – a gap that speaks to a broader neglect of observability at the network layer, the critical
foundation supporting all higher layers of the trillion-dollar cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Ethics
This study follows the Menlo Report’s [28] four principles for ethical ICT research: Respect for
Persons, Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law and Public Interest. We evaluate risks ex ante,
minimize potential harms during data collection and analysis, and practice transparency and
accountability. Our datasets deal exclusively with publicly available data, crawls take up minimal
connections (connect, ask for info, disconnect), and each node is connected to at a maximum once
every one or two hours. Our measurements target publicly reachable blockchain nodes rather than
individuals. No demographics or behavioral data about people were collected. Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses can be considered personal data in some jurisdictions; we therefore treat them as
sensitive technical identifiers.

daily new-IPs [%]
Fig. 13. Distribution of daily new-IP rates for each of the 15 blockchain networks. The new-IP rate on day 𝑡is
defined as the fraction of IPs active on day 𝑡that were not active on day 𝑡−1, expressed as a percentage of
the day 𝑡−1 active-IP count. Violin shapes show the full density of daily retention values, with inner quartiles
and medians indicated.
Figure 13 presents the distribution of the fraction of IPs active on day 𝑡that were not active on
day 𝑡−1, expressed as a percentage of the day 𝑡−1 active-IP count. Several networks exhibit a
nonzero lower bound in their new-IP distributions. For example, Bitcoin and Litecoin never drop
below roughly 2% – suggesting a persistent influx of fresh IPs, perhaps due to address rotation or
dynamic hosting. In contrast, smaller or more specialized networks such as Ripple, Avalanche, Near,
Celestia, and Avail display low new-IP rates (medians below 2%), reflecting highly stable networks.
We further examine the weekly IP retention rates in Figure 14. The distributions show that no
network retains 100% of nodes over the span of a week. While daily retention is generally extremely
high (cf. Figure 8), the effect of network churn compounds over several days. Ethereum (discv5) has
the lowest median retention at around 80%, whereas Avail shows the highest with a median above
95%. Most networks cluster above 90%, with larger networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (discv4 and
discv5), and Dogecoin falling slightly below that threshold.

We provide the country-level breakdown for each individual network in Figure 15. In most cases,
the United States and Germany host the largest fractions of peers, as expected. Notable exceptions
include Polkadot, where China holds the second-largest share, Filecoin, in which China contributes
the largest share of IPs, and Near, where Germany surpasses the United States as the primary host
of peers.

Table 8 reports the geographic distribution of active nodes per network, with blockchains in the
multi-network discovery protocol broken down. The breakdown highlights differences across
multi-network deployments: for instance, in the Ethereum (discv4) discovery protocol, Etho shows
a strong concentration in Europe, whereas Edgeware has only a small presence there. Similarly,
eCash exhibits higher activity in Asia and lower representation in North America compared to the
two other blockchains in the Bitcoin Cash (*) discovery protocol.

Network Overlap
We investigate node-level overlap in Figure 16, which reports the pairwise share of active IPs
between every discovery network on April 10, 2025. The strongest overlap (approximately 50%)
occurs between Ethereum (discv4) and Ethereum (discv5), reflecting the requirement to run nodes
in both networks when operating an Ethereum node. Recall that Ethereum nodes make up the
biggest proportion of the two networks. Further, both Ethereum networks also exhibit a modest
overlap (around 5–10%) with several other networks. This is not unexpected due to the diverse set
of blockchains in the networks.

% of IPs in network i present in network j
Fig. 16. Heatmap of the percentage overlap of active node IPs between blockchain networks on April 10, 2025.
Each cell at row 𝑖, column 𝑗shows the percentage of IPs active in network 𝑖that are also active in network 𝑗
on that date. The diagonal is masked, since it trivially represents 100% self–overlap. Note that Stellar is not
included in this figure, as we do not have data for the day.
Among the Bitcoin-based networks, we observe mutual overlaps of 20–35% between Bitcoin,
Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash (*) and Litecoin, indicating significant cross-participation. It is not surprising
that operators in these smaller networks would also operate a Bitcoin node. Some networks, such as
Ripple and Avalanche, overlap with multiple other chains at the 5–10% level, whereas Solana shows
minimal overlap (< 1%) with all other crawled networks, suggesting an almost entirely distinct set
of peers.
