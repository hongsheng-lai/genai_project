Abstract
In this work, we introduce a new Hybrid High-Order method for the numerical simula-
tion of fracture propagation based on phase-field models. The proposed method supports
general meshes made of polygonal/polyhedral elements, which provides great flexibility in
mesh design and adaptation, and can accommodate large variations of both the displace-
ment and damage variables thanks to the use of fully discontinuous spaces. The resolution
of the corresponding algebraic problem is based on a staggered time stepping scheme which
takes advantage of static condensation for each subproblem. We provide extensive numer-
ical validation of the method on classical two-dimensional fracture propagation problems,
including a comparison with a more standard finite element scheme.

Introduction
In this work, we introduce a new Hybrid High-Order (HHO) method for the numerical sim-
ulation of fracture propagation based on phase-field models. The proposed method supports
general meshes made of polygonal/polyhedral elements, which provides great flexibility in mesh
design and adaptation, and can accommodate large variations of both the displacement and
damage variables thanks to the use of fully discontinuous spaces. The corresponding algebraic
problem is solved using a staggered time stepping scheme with static condensation for each
subproblem.
Cracking is one of the most common failure mechanisms in engineering materials such
as concrete, ceramics, and composites, affecting structures like wind turbines, dams, ships,
containers, and buildings. Since the 1960s, several models and numerical methods have been
developed to simulate fracture mechanics, which can be broadly categorized into discrete and
continuous.
Discrete models [38] are quite intuitive in that they represent cracks as explicit disconti-
nuities in the material, allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous across the crack
surface. However, such discontinuities can be challenging to handle numerically as they intro-
duce a strong sensitivity to the mesh. This issue can be mitigated resorting to, e.g., enriched

finite elements [7, 37, 36, 47, 48], remeshing [38, 13, 12], or meshless approaches [9]. Other
difficulties in discrete models include modeling crack initiation, propagation, and branching,
especially in three-dimensional settings or complex geometries.
Continuous (smeared) crack models [42], on the other hand, represent cracks as diffused
zones within the material. The displacement jumps are smeared over a region of small but finite
width, while material behaviour gradually deteriorates near the crack to model the degradation
process. This approach avoids the complexities associated with tracking discrete crack surfaces,
and thus the need to correspondingly modify or locally adapt the mesh. Continuous models
are typically based on Continuum Damage Mechanics [31], where internal damage variables
represent the degradation of material properties due to microcrack formation and growth.
Continuous models have been widely used to model concrete fractures, for instance in [43, 39]
using standard Finite Element Methods (FEM), in [40, 8, 45] using FEM with embedded
discontinuities, or in [48] using extended FEM. A well-known limitation of these models is
their strong sensitivity to the mesh orientation, which can lead to non-physical results.
The starting point of the present paper are phase-field fracture/damage models, a particular
class of continuous models introduced in [27, 14].
These models introduce a scalar crack
phase-field to represent the state of the material, whose evolution is governed by a partial
differential equation rather than being postulated a priori.
Phase-field models enable the
simulation of complex crack patterns and provide a mathematically consistent framework to
account for crack nucleation, propagation, and branching without the need for explicit crack-
surface tracking. In [27, 15], based on Griffith’s theory [28], fracture propagation was conceived
as a competition between crack surface energy and bulk elastic energy stored in the material.
Later contributions [35, 34] introduced a more mechanically oriented and thermodynamically
consistent formulation, additionally accounting for the irreversibility of crack evolution. So far,
most numerical studies of phase-field models for fracture mechanics have relied on the Finite
Element Method (FEM); a non-exhaustive list includes [34, 35, 30, 2, 41, 46]. In the most
complex situations, however, FEM displays critical limitations in terms of supported meshes,
and extended versions can lead to poorly-conditioned algebraic systems.
We devise here what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first HHO discretization of
phase-field models.
Originally introduced in [26, 25], HHO methods can be regarded as a
generalization of the classical Crouzeix–Raviart finite element to general polygonal/polyhedral
meshes and arbitrary order [22]; see [21, 18] for a comprehensive introduction and also [20] for
a related method. Their distinctive advantage is the support of general polygonal/polyhedral
elements, which makes it possible, e.g., to treat in a seamless way transition elements in stan-
dard meshes, to use non-conforming local mesh refinement to increase resolution and mesh
agglomeration [4] to reduce the computational cost. Being constructed from spaces of broken
polynomial polynomials on the mesh and its skeleton, HHO methods can also naturally accom-
modate large variations in the solution. All of the above features make them particularly suited
for fracture modelling. The method proposed in the present work uses as a starting point: for
the mechanical equilibrium, the classical HHO discretizations of linear elasticity [25], modified
to incorporate a damage-dependent weight function; for the evolution of the crack phase-field,
the HHO method for scalar diffusion-advection-reaction proposed in [23], adapted to incorpo-
rate a history term. Since we cannot expect the exact solution to be regular, we focus on low
polynomial orders, which additionally results in smaller and more manageable algebraic prob-
lems. Time stepping relies on a staggered algorithm, where the mechanical equilibrium and
damage-field evolution subproblems are solved independently, combined with suitable strate-
gies for the history field update. For both subproblems, we additionally use static condensation
to further reduce the numerical costs.

Notice that this is not the first time that polyhedral methods have been applied to fracture
modelling. In [1], the authors propose a Virtual Element discretization of a phase-field model
analogous to the one considered here; see [5, 6] for an introduction to the Virtual Elements.
While this method shares several features with ours, it hinges on an entirely different set of
degrees of freedom, which resemble (but don’t coincide with) those of conforming Lagrange
finite elements, and is first-order accurate for both variables; we also refer to the more recent
contributions [16, 33, 17, 32, 44], all focusing on nodal Virtual Elements. From the engineering
point of view, a potential advantage of our method is that, where no damage is present, it yields
equilibrated tractions [24], and thus more physical solutions. Another potential advantage is
linked to the fact that the pattern of the resulting algebraic problems is smaller, since only
elements sharing a face (as opposed to a vertex) are connected.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly recall the phase-
field model along with various definitions of the history field. The HHO scheme is defined in
Section 3, while the staggered time stepping scheme used for the solution of the corresponding
algebraic problem makes the object of Section 4. Finally, a comprehensive numerical validation
is provided in Section 5, including a comparison with a more standard FEM scheme.

Continuous setting
Let Ω⊂R3 be a bounded domain corresponding to a medium in which a fracture propa-
gates. We denote by ∂Ωits boundary with outward unit normal vector n. The boundary is
decomposed as ∂Ω= ∂ΩD ⊔∂ΩN, where ∂ΩD and ∂ΩN are two non-overlapping portions where
displacement (Dirichlet) or normal stress (Neumann) conditions are respectively enforced. We
assume small deformations, so that the infinitesimal strain tensor corresponding to a displace-
ment field u : Ω→R3 is ε = ε(u) = ∇su, with ∇s denoting the symmmetric part of the
gradient applied to vector-valued fields.
Throughout the rest of the paper, when dealing with a function ψ of time and space, at any
time t for which ψ is defined, we let ψ(t) := ψ(t, ·) denote the function of space only obtained
fixing the first argument at t. We also use the shortcut notation ˙ψ to denote the time derivative
of ψ.
Denoting by tF the final time, the fracture propagation problem with phase-field approach
is formulated as follows: Given a prescribed boundary displacement uD : (0, tF] × ∂ΩD →R3,
an initial history field H0 : Ω→R, and an initial crack phase-field ϕ0 : Ω→[0, 1] satisfying
∇ϕ0 · n = 0 on ∂Ω, find the displacement field u : (0, tF] × Ω→R3 and the crack phase-field
ϕ : [0, tF] × Ω→R such that, for t ∈(0, tF],

The stress tensor σ(ε, ϕ) is defined by degrading the elastic stress according to the crack
phase-field variable, in order to reflect the fact that the stress vanishes in the fractured region:
σ(ε, ϕ) := g(ϕ) σ0(ε).
Above, denoting by λ and µ the Lam´e coefficients, σ0(ε) denotes the standard linear isotropic
elasticity stress tensor expressed in terms of the elastic energy ψ0 as
σ0(ε) := ∂ψ0(ε)
∂ε
= 2µ ε + λ tr(ε) I where ψ0(ε) := λ

tr(ε)
2 + µ ε : ε,
(2)
with g denoting a degradation function satisfying g(0) = 1 and g(1) = 0. We adopt the common
choice g(ϕ) = (1 −ϕ)2. In (1b), Gc is the critical energy release rate from Griffith’s theory and
ℓis a length-scale parameter controlling the width of the diffused crack zone. The term η ˙ϕ
introduces a viscous regularization with no particular physical meaning, and can be omitted if
rate-independent evolution is desired by setting η = 0.
Remark (The role of time). The system (1) is formulated under quasi-static assumptions. In
this setting, the variable t does not represent a physical time, but rather a measure of the
progression of the applied load. For this reason, it is often referred to as a pseudo-time, and a
pseudo-time or time increment simply corresponds to a loading step.
The first equation (1a) expresses a macroscopic equilibrium condition. Equation (1b) is
the crack phase-field evolution equation, a micro-balance governing the fracture evolution in
which the right-hand side is the driving force. The fracture irreversibility is enforced through
the history field H, defined as
H(t) := max
τ∈[0,t] ψ0(ε(τ)),
(3)
which ensures, in particular, that H is non-decreasing in time. Using this definition of H leads
to the so-called isotropic formulation, where both tensile and compressive components of the
strain energy equally contribute to fracture growth.
This model may, however, yield unphysical crack propagation under compression due to
interpenetration. To better capture realistic fracture behaviors, it is customary to distinguish
tensile (denoted with the superscript “+”) and compressive (denoted with the superscript “−”)
contributions to the elastic energy:
ψ0(ε) = ψ+
0 (ε) + ψ−
0 (ε),
(4)
and to use only the tensile part in the fracture driving force,
H(t) = max
τ∈[0,t] ψ+
0 (ε(τ)).
(5)
This choice defines the hybrid formulation. Different criteria exist for performing the split (4).
One possibility consists in using the following spectral decomposition of the strain tensor:
ε =
3
X
a=1
εa na ⊗na,
where εa (a = 1, 2, 3) are the principal strains and na the corresponding principal directions.
Defining
ε+ :=
3
X
a=1
ε⊕
a na ⊗na and ε−:=
3
X
a=1
ε⊖
a na ⊗na,
4


with α⊕:= |α|+α
2
and α⊖:= |α|−α
2
respectively denoting the positive and negative parts of α,
the spectral decomposition (SP) of the elastic energy reads [35]:
ψ+
0 (ε) := λ
2
 [tr ε]⊕2 + µ ε+ : ε+ and ψ−
0 (ε) := λ
2
 [tr ε]⊖2 + µ ε−: ε−.
(6)
Notice that both contributions are non-negative. The evaluation of this energy requires com-
puting the eigenstructure of the strain tensor, which makes the procedure more computationally
demanding. An alternative is the volumetric–deviatoric decomposition (VD) of [3]:
ψ+
0 (ε) := 1
2K
 [tr ε]⊕2 + µ (ε′ : ε′),
ψ−
0 (ε) := 1
2K
 [tr ε]⊖2 ,
(7)
where ε′ := ε −1
3 tr(ε)I is the deviatoric component of the strain tensor, and K = λ + 2
3µ is
the bulk modulus.
Problem (1) with the isotropic definition of the history field (3) is referred to as the isotropic
formulation, as the crack is equally driven by both energy components, whereas the version
using (5) is referred to as the hybrid formulation, which better distinguishes fracture behav-
ior under tension and compression. The term hybrid reflects the intermediate nature of this
model, which lies between the isotropic formulation and the fully anisotropic one, where the
tension–compression split is also applied to the equilibrium equation, a case not considered
here.
Remark (Two-dimensional case). The model described above is formulated in three dimensions.
In the numerical experiments of Section 5, we consider the two-dimensional case obtained under
the plane strain assumption, namely ε13 = ε23 = ε33 = 0. In what follows, we stick to the
three-dimensional terminology for the sake of simplicity.

HHO Scheme
We consider a computational mesh Mh = Th ∪Fh covering the domain Ω. The mesh is made
of non-overlapping elements T ∈Th, each having a polyhedral shape, and of (planar) polygonal
faces F ∈Fh, which can be either internal or located on the boundary. Additional details on
the assumptions and properties of such general meshes can be found in [21, Chapter 1].
3.1
Discrete spaces
The vector-valued HHO space used for the displacement field is spanned by vector of local
functions attached to cells and faces:
V 1
h :=
n
vh = ((vT )T∈Th, (vF )F∈Fh) :
vT ∈P1(T)3 for all T ∈Th and vF ∈P1(F)3 for all F ∈Fh
o
,
where, for X ∈Mh mesh cell or face, P1(X) is spanned by the restriction to X of linear
polynomials in the space variables. Notice that, contrary to finite elements, we do not define
here a global space of functions over Ω, but rather work directly on the values of the degrees
of freedom, which correspond to polynomial moments of degree up to one over each X ∈Mh.
Similarly, the scalar HHO space used for the space discretization of the crack phase-field is
defined as
V 0
h :=
n
ϕh = ((ϕT )T∈Th, (ϕF )F∈Fh) :
ϕT ∈P0(T) for all T ∈Th and ϕF ∈P0(F) for all F ∈Fh
o
,
5


with P0(X) spanned by constant functions over X ∈Mh. For future use, for any ϕh ∈V 0
h, we
denote by ϕh the broken polynomial function on Ωobtained patching cell values, i.e.,
(ϕh)|T := ϕT for all T ∈Th.
(8)
Remark (Choice of the polynomial degrees). Given the nature of problem (1), one cannot
expect, in general, high regularity for the exact solution. This advocates for the use of low
polynomial orders for both the displacement field and the crack phase-field. Moreover, in the
context of nonlinear problems, low-order schemes often translate into algebraic problems that
are easier to solve numerically. Notice that the space for displacements is taken of degree 1 in-
stead of 0 as this is required for the stability of the standard HHO formulation for elasticity [25];
see also [11, 21] on this subject. Using the space of degree 0 would require specific modifications
to recover stability. One possibility is to add additional stabilization terms, which results in
a method with a larger stencil [10]. Alternatively, stability can also be achieved without en-
larging the stencil by defining the HHO space on suitable subfaces, provided that unisolvency
for rigid-body motions is preserved [19], though this comes at the price of a larger number of
degrees of freedom.
In what follows, given a cell T ∈Th, we will respectively denote by V 1
T and V 0
T the
restrictions of V 1
h and V 0
h to T, obtained collecting the components associated with T and
its faces. Hence, for example, ϕT ∈V 0
T denotes the vector (ϕT , (ϕF )F∈FT ), with FT ⊂Fh
collecting the faces of T.
3.2
Discretization of the mechanical equilibrium equation
The mechanical equilibrium equation (1a) features a linear elastic response weighted by a degra-
dation function depending on the crack phase-field ϕ. The starting point for our formulation
is therefore the standard HHO scheme for elasticity [25].
3.2.1
Strain reconstruction operator
To discretize the stress tensor, we introduce an affine strain reconstruction designed by mim-
icking discrete integration-by-parts formulas. Specifically, let T ∈Th be a mesh element and
let P1(T; R3×3
Sym) denote the space of symmetric matrix-valued fields with linear polynomial
components, i.e.,
P1(T; R3×3
Sym) :=


τ =


a
b
c
b
d
e
c
e
f

: a, b, c, d, e, f ∈P1(T)


.
Given vT = (vT , (vF )F∈FT ) ∈V 1
T , the strain reconstruction E1
T vT ∈P1(T; R3×3
Sym) is defined
mimicking an integration by parts formula:

vF · (τnTF )
for all τ ∈P1(T; R3×3
Sym),
where nTF denotes the normal vector to F pointing out of T. Crucially, this strain reconstruc-
tion is one order higher than the one obtained by applying the symmetric gradient operator to
the element component vT , making the resulting scheme comparable to a P2 FEM in terms of
accuracy. The associated divergence reconstruction operator is then naturally defined setting

3.2.2
Global discrete function ah
We are now ready to define the global discrete function ah : (V 1
h × V 0
h) × V 1
h →R such that,
for all uh, vh ∈V 1
h and all ϕh ∈V 0
h,
ah((uh, ϕh), vh) :=
X
T∈Th
g(ϕT ) aT (uT , vT ),
with, for all T ∈Th,
aT (uT , vT ) :=
Z
T

2µ E1
T uT : E1
T vT + λ D1
T uT D1
T vT

+ 2µ sT (uT , vT ).
(9)
Notice that, when ϕT = 0 for all T ∈Th (unfractured medium), ah reduces to the standard HHO
bilinear form for linear elasticity. The local bilinear form (9) is composed of two contributions,
respectively in charge of consistency and stability. The stabilization term sT is designed so
that:
(S1) aT vanishes only when one of its arguments corresponds to the interpolation of a rigid-
body motion;
(S2) sT vanishes whenever the exact displacement is a quadratic function.
In order to fulfill these properties, sT must have a very specific dependence on its arguments,
which requires the introduction of a reconstructed quadratic displacement field. Denoting by
P2(T) the space of quadratic polynomials on T, for a given vT = (vT , (vF )F∈FT ) ∈V 1
T , we
define p2
T vT ∈P2(T)3 such that its symmetric gradient is the projection of E1

with ∇ss denoting the skew-symmetric part of the gradient applied to vector-valued fields. This
quadratic displacement field can be equivalently characterized as providing the best approxi-

Discretization of the crack phase-field evolution equation
The crack phase-field equation (1b) can regarded as an evolutive diffusion–reaction equation for
the crack phase-field. Linear standalone equations of this kind have been extensively studied,
and the corresponding HHO discretizations are well-established. We specifically use here as a
starting point the method of [23] (see also [21, Chapter 3]), which is modified to accommodate
the specific fracture driving terms arising in our model.
3.3.1
Local reconstructions
As in the mechanical problem, we introduce a higher-order polynomial reconstruction operator
for the crack phase-field. Specifically, for any cell T ∈Th, given ϕT = (ϕT , (ϕF )F∈FT ) ∈V 0
T ,
the affine phase-variable reconstruction p1
T ϕT , obtained in a similar spirit as the displacement
reconstruction (10), is such that

Global discrete function bh
Given a bounded function H : Ω→R, we define bh(H ; ·, ·) : V 0

Discrete history field variable
Let T ∈Th be a mesh element.
The time-dependent quantity HT represents the discrete
counterpart of the history field (3), i.e., the maximum of the elastic energy density over time.
At a point in time t, for the isotropic formulation, we set
HT (t) := max
τ∈[0,t] ψ0(E1
T uT (τ)),
with ψ0 defined by (2), while, for the hybrid formulation, we let
HT (t) := max
τ∈[0,t] ψ+
0 (E1
T uT (τ)),
where ψ+
0 is given by (6) or (7), depending on the selected decomposition. At the global level,
we then define the function of time Hh : [0, tF] × Ω→R such that, for t ∈[0, tF],
(Hh(t))|T := HT (t)
for all T ∈Th.

3.4
Space semi-discrete problem
We define the following subspaces of V 1
h respectively incorporating non-homogeneous and ho-
mogeneous boundary conditions on ∂ΩD:
V 1
h,D :=

vh ∈V 1
h :
vF = π1

.
Notice that uD is a function of time, and so is therefore V 1
h,D. Hence, vh ∈V 1
h,D means that
vh is a function of time with values in V 1
h and such that the boundary condition is satisfied
at each time t ∈(0, tF]. The space semi-discrete problem, counterpart of (1), reads as follows:
Find uh ∈V 1

Staggered time stepping scheme
Problem (12) is a strongly non-linear system of ordinary differential equations the solution of
which requires carefully tailored resolution strategies. We describe hereafter the one used in
the numerical simulations of Section 5.
4.1
Time discretization and non-linear iterations
The time discretization hinges on a uniform partition of size τ > 0 of the time interval [0, tF]:
0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tN = tF with tn+1 −tn = τ for n = 0, . . . , N −1.
At each time step tn, for n = 1, . . . , N, we let V 1,n
h,D := V 1
h,D(tn) and denote by (un
h, ϕn
h, Hn
T )
the approximation of (uh(tn), ϕ(tn), Hh(tn)). The non-linear algebraic system to advance from
time step tn to time step tn+1 is solved by means of the iterative method described hereafter.
We initialize the crack phase-field and history field using the values at the previous time step:
ϕn+1,0

We exit the non-linear iterations when the relative increment of both the displacement field and
crack phase-field between two consecutive iterations is under a user-defined threshold. Some
remarks are of order.
Remark (The case of volumetric-deviatoric energy split). When using the volumetric–deviatoric
energy split (7) for the tensile and compressive parts of the strain energy, both subproblems (13)
and (14) are linear.
Remark (Static condensation). In both subproblems, the global systems are solved using static
condensation: the cell unknowns are locally eliminated, yielding condensed systems that involve
only face unknowns. Once the global problem is solved, the cell unknowns are recovered solving
an inexpensive equation. This procedure significantly reduces the computational cost.
4.2
History field update
Let a cell T ∈Th, a time step n, and a non-linear iteration m be given. We discuss here the
history field update in Step 2 of the algorithm presented in Section 4.1. We assume that we
have stored the value εn+1,m
T
∈P1(T; R3×3
Sym) of the strain reconstruction corresponding to the
largest elastic energy attained so far.
Given a function f : T →R, let fmax denote its maximum over the quadrature nodes of T.
The value of the discrete strain tensor associated with the largest energy is then updated as
εn+1,m+1
T
=




T un+1,m+1
T
if ψ∗, max

(E1

T
) > Hn+1,m, max
T
,
εn+1,m
T
otherwise,
where ψ∗
0 denotes either ψ0 for the isotropic formulation or ψ+
0 for the hybrid one. Notice that
another option consists in replacing Hn+1,m, max
T
with Hn, max
T
in the above equation. Finally,
the cell history field is updated setting
Hn+1,m+1
T
= ψ∗
0(εn+1,m+1
T
).
Remark (Update at quadrature nodes). The above strategy to update the history field yields
a polynomial Hn+1,m+1
T
within each cell, which can facilitate the transfer of this quantity
between meshes when local mesh refinement is used. An alternative consists in first replacing
the integrals in (14) with quadratures and then storing and updating the history field at each
quadrature node. In the numerical experiments we performed, both strategies essentially yields
the same results.

Numerical simulations
We tested the proposed scheme on two standard benchmark problems in fracture mechanics.
Both the isotropic and the hybrid formulations were implemented, and for the hybrid one we
considered both the spectral (6) and the volumetric-deviatoric (7) energy decompositions. Our
implementation is based on the open source HArDCore library1.
5.1
Traction test
The first benchmark corresponds to the so-called mode I tensile test. We consider a square
domain of 1 mm side length containing an initial vertical notch of length 0.5 mm, as shown in
Figure 1. A zero displacement is imposed on the right side, while on the left side a monotonically
increasing displacement is enforced in the direction normal to the edge, pointing outward. The
prescribed displacement starts from zero and increases linearly with an increment of 1×10−5 mm
per time step for the first 500 steps, and then with a smaller increment of 1×10−6 mm per time
step to better capture the sudden crack propagation. The domain is discretized using a refined
family of uniform conforming triangular meshes, and the phase-field regularization length is set
to ℓ= 0.0075 mm. The Lam´e parameters are µ = 80.77 kN mm−2 and λ = 121.15 kN mm−2,
while the critical energy release rate is set to Gc = 2.7 × 10−3 kN mm−1.
The evolution of the crack phase-field ϕ at different time steps is shown in Figure 2 for
the three formulations implemented with the HHO method: isotropic, hybrid-VD (with energy
decomposition (7)), and hybrid-SP (with energy decomposition (6)). The three formulations
exhibit very similar behavior in this test, with a crack propagating straight from the initial
notch to the top boundary, as expected from physical experiments and the literature.
A mesh convergence study was also performed. Figure 3 shows the load–displacement curves
obtained with a family of uniform triangular meshes of size h ∈{0.0177 mm, 0.0088 mm, 0.0044 mm}
for the hybrid–VD formulation. The horizontal axis represents the magnitude of the prescribed
displacement uleft at each time step applied on the left boundary, while the vertical axis reports
the magnitude of the average reaction force computed on the same boundary. A convergence

trend can be observed as the mesh is refined, with the curves tending to stabilize for mesh sizes
smaller than h = 0.01 mm .
In Figure 4 we compare the load-displacement curves obtained with our HHO scheme with
those obtained using Lagrange P2-P1 finite elements on a family of triangular meshes. The
FEM simulations are performed with the FreeFEM++ software [29]. For HHO, we consider
three uniform triangular meshes with sizes h ∈{0.02 mm, 0.01 mm, 0.005 mm}.
For FEM,
we reuse the same uniform mesh with h = 0.005 mm used for HHO and, in addition, three
non-uniform meshes generated adaptively with FreeFem++, featuring minimum element sizes
respectively equal to 1 × 10−4 mm, 1 × 10−5 mm, and 1 × 10−6 mm. We can observe that both
methods tend to converge to the same solution as the mesh is refined, but with HHO showing a
faster convergence despite the fact that the simulations are carried out on non-adaptive meshes.
We also tested our scheme on a hexagonal mesh, which is shown in Figure 5. The results
are consistent with those obtained on triangular meshes, and confirm that the method behaves
similarly across different mesh topologies.
Remark (Initial notch). To model an initial notch in the domain, we considered two different
approaches. In the tests with triangular meshes (see Figures 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10), the discontinuity
is modeled by introducing a physical cut in the mesh, obtained by duplicating the nodes along
the notch line (highlighted in blue in Figure 6a). While this approach is straightforward, it
requires the mesh to conform exactly to the notch geometry, which can be problematic for
complex geometries.
The second approach removes this problem by using an initial history field H0 with high
values along the notch line, thus effectively simulating a pre-existing crack without altering
the mesh topology, as shown in Figure 6b. This method offers greater flexibility, since the
mesh no longer needs to match the notch geometry. It requires, however, careful calibration of
the initial history field to correctly represent the notch. We used this approach for tests with
polygonal meshes (see Figure 5).

5.2
Shear test
The second benchmark corresponds to the mode II shear loading test. We consider the same
domain as in the traction test, but with a displacement applied on the left boundary in the
upward direction, as shown on the right in Figure 1. The prescribed displacement increases
monotonically, starting from zero and incremented linearly by 1 × 10−5 mm at each time step.
We use triangular meshes locally refined where the crack is expected to propagate (see Figure 8).
The Lam´e parameters λ and µ, the critical energy release rate Gc, and the regularization length
ℓare the same as in the traction test. Also in this case, several simulations are performed to
investigate the convergence of the method and to compare the results obtained with the HHO
scheme to those reported in the literature using other discretization methods. In Figure 7 we
show the evolution of ϕ at different time steps for hybrid-VD and hybrid-SP formulations.
The load–displacement curves for the hybrid–VD formulation obtained with a family of
locally refined meshes similar to the one depicted in Figure 8 with minimum element sizes in
{0.008 13 mm, 0.003 90 mm, 0.001 85 mm}, are shown in Figure 9. As in the traction test, the
horizontal axis represents the magnitude of the prescribed displacement uleft at each loading
increment, applied on the left boundary, while the vertical axis reports the magnitude of the
average reaction force computed on the same boundary. A convergence trend can be observed
as the mesh is refined, with the curves tending to stabilize for mesh sizes smaller than 0.004 mm.
Notice that, for the coarsest mesh, the mesh size is larger than ℓ, which can justify the significant
difference with respect to the two finest meshes.
In Figure 10 we provide a comparison with Lagrange P2-P1 FEM discretization on a family
of locally refined triangular meshes. For HHO we consider the same meshes as for the previous
convergence test, similar to the one shown in Figure 8, while for FEM we use three non-
uniform meshes generated adaptively with FreeFem++, featuring minimum element sizes in
{1×10−3 mm, 1×10−4 mm, 1×10−5 mm}. We can observe that both methods tend to converge
to the same solution as the mesh is refined and, once again, HHO appears to reach the exact
solution faster than FEM.
