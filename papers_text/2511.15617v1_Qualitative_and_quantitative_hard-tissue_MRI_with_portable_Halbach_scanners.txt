Abstract—
Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of performing in vivo imag-
ing and quantitative relaxation mapping of soft and hard tissues using
a low-cost, portable MRI scanner, and to establish the methodological
foundations for zero echo time (ZTE) imaging in systems affected by
strong field inhomogeneities.
Methods: A complete framework for artifact-free ZTE imaging
at low field was developed, including: (i) RF pulse pre/counter-
emphasis calibration to minimize ring-down and electronics switching
time; (ii) an extension of a recent single-point double-shot (SPDS)
protocol for simultaneous 𝐵0 and 𝐵1 mapping; and (iii) a model-based
reconstruction incorporating these field maps into the encoding matrix.
ZTE imaging and variable flip angle (VFA)𝑇1 mapping were performed
on phantoms and in vivo human knees and ankles, and benchmarked
against standard RARE and STIR acquisitions.
Results: The optimized PETRA sequence produced 3D images of
knees and ankles within clinically compatible times (< 15 min),
revealing hard tissues such as ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and bone
that are invisible in spin-echo sequences. The extended SPDS method
enabled accurate field mapping, while the VFA approach provided the
first in vivo 𝑇1 measurements of hard tissues at 𝐵0 < 0.1 T.
Conclusions: The proposed framework broadens the range of pulse
sequences feasible in portable low-field MRI and demonstrates the
potential of ZTE for quantitative and structural imaging of muscu-
loskeletal tissues in affordable Halbach-based systems.

I. Introduction
In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploring
the potential of low-field MRI (LF-MRI, 𝐵0 < 0.5 T) as a way
to enhance accessibility and democratize medical imaging [1],
[2], [3], [4], [5]. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) deficit inherent
to this regime is inevitable compared to clinical standards
(𝐵0 = 1.5 and 3 T), resulting in anatomical images of lower
resolution than those obtained with conventional MRI. Never-
theless, a variety of strategies have been developed to make
LF-MRI reconstructions diagnostically useful, including both
hardware optimization [6], [7] and software-based enhancement
[8].
Particularly interesting are scanners employing a Halbach-
array main magnet [9], which can provide sufficient 𝐵0 strength
and homogeneity while substantially reducing the weight,

footprint, and cost of MRI systems [10], [11], [12]. Halbach-
based systems have shown potential in diverse scenarios, such
as mounted on vehicles [13], [14], at crowded sporting events
[15], or even for home-based imaging [5].
Even so, the limited hardware capabilities of Halbach systems
constrain the range of pulse sequences (and thereby clinical
applications) that can be implemented [7]. The effects of the
relatively poor 𝐵0 homogeneity is alleviated through spin-echo
refocusing sequences [16], [17], which mitigate the SNR loss.
This encoding strategy is, however, only suitable for tissues
with long transverse relaxation times (𝑇2 > 20 ms), a condition
typically met only by water-rich soft tissues.
However, a variety of tissues in the human body are charac-
terized by short 𝑇2 times (even < 1 ms), including bone, lungs,
ligaments, tendons, and teeth [18]. The NMR signal from these
tissues is heavily attenuated and X-ray-based imaging techniques
are favored. Nonetheless, the ability to directly visualize them
using low-cost MRI could offer substantial diagnostic and
therapeutic advantages over conventional radiography. Unlike
X-rays, MRI enables innocuous and direct assessment of
fiber continuity, thickness, and internal signal of tendons and
ligaments, as well as early detection of subcortical bone marrow
edema, microfractures, and cartilage degeneration [19].
To image these tissues, dedicated pulse sequences have
been developed. These include ultra-short echo time (UTE)
[20], zero echo time (ZTE) [21], or Sweep Imaging with
Fourier Transformation (SWIFT) [22]. Their performance has
been validated across scanners of varying 𝐵0 and for diverse
applications, such as imaging and diagnosis of pulmonary
[23], cartilaginous [24], ligamentous [25], and dental lesions
[26], [27], even at fields as low as 260 mT [28]. In exchange,
these sequences are generally hardware-demanding, requiring
high 𝐵0 homogeneity, substantial radio-frequency (RF) power,
and strong gradients. Such requirements conflict with the
capabilities of low-cost, Halbach-based systems, hence hard-
tissue imaging remains unproven with portable scanners.
In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of
the feasibility of applying ZTE sequences in a portable Halbach
system originally designed for in vivo brain and musculoskeletal
imaging with spin-echo acquisitions. To overcome signal losses
associated with RF switching delays at low field, we implement

(PETRA) sequence [29]. To compensate the limited hardware
capabilities of portable Halbach systems, we introduce model-
based reconstructions that incorporate prior knowledge (PK)
of the main (𝐵0) and RF (𝐵1) field inhomogeneities. This PK
is obtained via an extension of the Single-Point Double-Shot
(SPDS) protocol [30]. In addition, we extend PETRA to generate
in vivo quantitative spin-lattice relaxation (𝑇1) maps using a
variable flip-angle approach (VFA-PETRA) under incoherent
steady-state conditions. This strategy enables the simultaneous
quantification of 𝑇1 times in muscle and fat, as well as structures
typically invisible to MRI, including tendons, ligaments, and
cortical bone.
II. Background & theory
A. Relaxation and dead times
Some aspects should be considered when advancing towards
ZTE with Halbach systems. One of the key challenges is the
available time margin for NMR signal acquisition. In ZTE, the
receive (Rx) window should start only after switching the RF
electronics from transmit (Tx) to Rx mode. This dead time
(𝑇dead) reflects the combined effects of the coil ring-down (with
time-constant 𝜏) and the saturation of the RF line following
the Tx pulse. If acquisition begins while the energy stored in
the resonator still competes with the amplitude of the NMR
signal, the low-frequency samples of 𝑘-space will contain a
spurious contribution that often manifests as a sinc-type artifact
in the image (see Fig. 4a)I). Furthermore, the duration of
the acquisition window (𝑇acq) is constrained by the coherence
time of the NMR signal (𝑇∗
2 ) evolving under 𝐵0(®𝑟). When
the acquisition extends beyond this limit (i.e., 𝑇acq > 𝑇∗
2 ), the
reconstruction exhibits apodization and blurring artifacts at the
image periphery (see Fig. 4a)V). Both factors are particularly
unfavorable in our regime. On one hand, 𝜏scales as ∝2𝑄/𝜔L,
where 𝑄is the quality factor of the coil and 𝜔L is the Larmor
frequency, so ring-down times are particularly long for high-𝑄
coils in LF-MRI. On the other, the lightweight and compact
design of the Halbach magnet compromises 𝐵0 homogeneity,
limiting the maximum achievable transverse coherence time to
𝑇∗
2 ∼1 ms even in substances with 𝑇2 > 1 s (see Fig. 3b).
B. RF pulse quality
In any ZTE sequence, spin excitation occurs once the
encoding gradient has reached its set value. To ensure uniform
and coherent excitation of all spins within the sample, very
short rectangular RF pulses are essential [31]. Only in this
way does the excitation bandwidth uniformly cover the spectral
range given by Δ𝜔= 𝛾· (Δ ®𝐵0(®𝑟) + |®𝑔enc(®𝑟, 𝑡)|), with ®𝑔enc
the gradient field for spatial encoding and 𝛾the 𝑔-factor
(𝛾= 2𝜋· 42.57 MHz/T for 1H). Achieving relevant flip angles
(FAs) with such short pulses, however, demands high-power
RF amplification. For our purposes, we prefer a high-𝑄coil
(to maximize SNR) and RF pulses with a square envelope and
maximum duration of 𝑡RF = 30 µs (see Fig. 4c). In this regime,
𝐵1 pulses can be suboptimal, since the expected rectangular
profile of ®𝐵1(𝑡) is dominated by the current rise time (see
Fig. 2a). This distortion acts as a low-pass filter, reducing the
excitation bandwidth and causing FA degradation toward the
peripheral regions of the sample.
C. System heating
Another challenge is the requirement for high continuous
gradient currents during each repetition. While this minimizes
eddy currents, it may compromise thermal stability during long
studies, particularly for sequences with TR ≫𝑇1. Scanners
designed for ZTE typically employ water-cooled gradient
systems [28], but this is impractical for portable designs. In
our case, the high efficiency and low resistance of the copper
plate-based gradients keep Joule effects low (see Sec. III-A),
so 2 mm-resolution PETRA sequences lead to minor heating
even for TR = 250 ms (𝑔enc = 5.8 mT/m, 𝐼𝑥= 9.5 A, so
𝑃< 8 W in the worst-case scenario and assuming full duty
cycle). Nevertheless, during long in vivo acquisitions exceeding
one hour, the Larmor frequency may drift (see Fig. 3d).
D. Sequence duration
A further drawback of PETRA sequences is their relatively
long acquisition time, primarily due to: (i) the need to sample
the pointwise region of 𝑘-space; (ii) the impossibility of forming
long echo trains to fill multiple 𝑘-space lines per repetition; and
(iii) the inherently three-dimensional nature of ZTE. Although
sequences combining slice selection with ZTE are available
[30], such approaches demand high homogeneity in all magnetic
fields, which is difficult to achieve in portable Halbach systems.
The duration of a PETRA sequence depends on the matrix
size and maximum field of view (𝑁max and FoVmax), the radial
undersampling factor (USrad), and the ratio𝑇dead/𝑇acq, according
to:

, (1)
where 𝑁av is the number of averages. For typical knee imaging
resolutions of 2 mm with fully sampled 𝑘-space, a ratio of
𝑇dead/𝑇acq = 200 µs/1 ms implies that approximately 15 % of
the total sequence time is spent filling the central region of 𝑘-
space point by point (𝑁rad = 25, 250, 𝑁sp = 3, 616), making
PETRA relatively time-inefficient.
E. Imaging in inhomogeneous 𝐵0 and 𝐵1 fields
ZTE sequences, due to the radial measurement of signals
decaying with 𝑇∗
2 without spin refocusing, are particularly
sensitive to artifacts arising from 𝐵0 inhomogeneity. Under these
circumstances, the reconstruction of 𝑘-space using algorithms
agnostic to the physics of the problem tends to exhibit blurring,
anisotropic degradation of resolution, and hyperintense bands in
pixels where the encoding field ( ®𝐵0(®𝑟) + ®𝑔enc(®𝑟, 𝑡)) is extremal.
In addition, the use of solenoidal coils results in a spatial
modulation of both the transmission and reception efficiencies.
This fact causes two effects: (i) a defective FA calibration, since
the Rabi flops reflect the integrated contribution of all spins
that have been excited with a position-dependent FA, which
depends on the deviation of the 𝐵1 field from its average value;
and (ii) a spatial modulation of brightness in the reconstruction
even if the FA is homogeneous across the entire sample. This
indeterminacy is especially critical when employing a variable-
flip-angle (VFA) method for𝑇1 quantification (see Sec. II-H). To


3
overcome the uncertainties caused by the presence of magnetic
field inhomogeneities, prior knowledge of the distributions of
𝐵0(®𝑟) and 𝐵1(®𝑟) is essential.
F. Mapping the 𝐵0 and 𝐵1 fields
For 𝐵0 and 𝐵1 mapping, one can adopt the strategy proposed
in Ref. [30], extending its use to simultaneously obtain maps
of 𝐵0(®𝑟) and 𝐵1(®𝑟) with immunity to spatial distortions. The
extended method is based on three fast, low-resolution SPRITE
sequences that are identical except for their nominal flip angles
(𝛼i,nom) and dead times (𝑇i,d), each producing a reconstruction
𝜌𝑖. Ideally, these sequences should be applied to a structureless
phantom with homogeneous 𝑇1 that fills the available imaging
volume.
Analogously to the SPDS approach, the phase maps arg(𝜌1)
and arg(𝜌2) are cropped to a common mask and subsequently
unwrapped in three dimensions. Their subtraction yields a map
of deviations in the main field:
Δ𝐵0(®𝑟) ≈arg(𝜌2) −arg(𝜌1)
𝛾 𝑇2,d −𝑇1,d

.
(2)
The magnitude maps abs(𝜌1) and abs(𝜌3) exhibit a common
spatial modulation of brightness, such that the local flip angle
𝛼𝑖(®𝑟) deviates from its nominal value, estimated as 𝛼i,nom =
𝛾𝐵1i,nom 𝑡RF (assuming negligible 𝐵0 inhomogeneity). The actual
FA distribution is therefore:
𝛼𝑖(®𝑟) = 𝛾𝐵i,eff(®𝑟) 𝑡RF,
(3)
where 𝐵i,eff(®𝑟) =
√︃
(𝐵1i,nom 𝜂(®𝑟))2 + (Δ𝐵0(®𝑟))2 is the position-
dependent effective field in the rotating frame, and 𝜂(®𝑟) is
a dimensionless map representing the scaling between the
nominal 𝐵1 strength (𝐵1i,nom, calibrated from Rabi flops and
corresponding to the spatially averaged 𝐵1 amplitude within the
sample) and the actual 𝐵1 at each pixel within the region of
interest (RoI):
𝐵1(®𝑟) = 𝐵1,nom · 𝜂(®𝑟).
(4)
Because 𝑇1 is known a priori and homogeneous throughout
the imaging volume, the relative brightness modulation between
SPRITE images with different flip angles arises solely from 𝐵1
inhomogeneity. Therefore, the pixelwise ratio of abs(𝜌1) and
abs(𝜌3) is given by the ratio of their steady-state signals:
abs(𝜌1)
abs(𝜌3) =

(5)
Here, 𝑛𝑖,𝑥and 𝑛𝑖,𝑧denote the components of the unit vector
pointing along ®𝐵eff in the rotating frame:

and 𝑀i,ss is the longitudinal magnetization reached in the
incoherent steady state:

(7)
where 𝐸1 = exp(−TR/𝑇1).
Once the matrix abs(𝜌1)/abs(𝜌3) is computed and masked to
select the phantom region, Eq. (5) can be solved for 𝜂(®𝑟) at each
voxel, using the Δ𝐵0(®𝑟) map obtained from Eq. (2). This can be
used for mapping the effective 𝐵1(®𝑟) field strength according to
Eq. (4).
This method effectively decouples the combined effects of 𝐵0
and 𝐵1 inhomogeneities on their respective maps. On one hand,
𝐵1 inhomogeneity introduces a common brightness modulation
across the three images, but this does not affect the 𝐵0 map, since
its estimation relies solely on the phase of 𝜌, which is insensitive
to amplitude variations. On the other, 𝐵0 inhomogeneity induces
geometric distortions that could otherwise deform the maps.
However, the use of SPRITE sequences with encoding times
below 500 µs ensures robustness of the 𝜌images against such
distortions, even when reconstructed using general algorithms
such as the FFT. Moreover, since the pair of images used to define
the 𝐵1 field share identical encoding times, their geometric
deformation is the same and could, if necessary, be corrected by
reconstructing them using the previously obtained 𝐵0 map as a
prior. As a result, the ratio of their magnitudes remains exact
and free from spatial mixing effects due to 𝐵0 inhomogeneity.
G. Standard relaxation mapping
The literature on the relaxation times of human tissues at
low magnetic fields remains scarce, and models predicting their
field dependence have been only marginally validated with in
vivo data [32], [33], [34]. Although some reports of 𝑇1 and 𝑇2
measurements exist for 𝐵0 values close to ours [35], [36], we
chose to independently measure the relaxation parameters of fat
and muscle in the knee at 𝐵0 = 90 mT. For this purpose, we
employed classical quantification methods for 𝑇2 and 𝑇1 based
on images acquired with Cartesian multi–spin-echo sequences
and variable TE/TI, as described in Sec. III-E. More efficient
approaches such as MR fingerprinting [37] were not used, as
they proved impractical in our control system due to current
data streaming limitations. This initial strategy for quantifying
𝑇1 and 𝑇2 serves as a reference for the expected relaxation times
of fat and muscle, which will later be used for comparison with
values obtained using more advanced methods such as VFA-
PETRA.
H. VFA-PETRA relaxation mapping
𝑇1 mapping using the variable flip angle (VFA) method is
a long-established approach [38], [39] widely used in high-
field MRI for rapid relaxometry of soft tissues. Recently, the
VFA method has been successfully combined with sequences
designed for short-𝑇2 components, such as UTE for mouse lungs
[40] and ZTE for the human brain [41]. However, these reports
were obtained in high-performance clinical systems operating at
𝐵0 ≥3 T, where SNR and field inhomogeneities are not critical
limitations.
When 𝐵1 is inhomogeneous but 𝐵0 remains highly uniform,
in vivo 𝑇1 mapping of soft tissues can be achieved by combining
VFA with spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) sequences, provided
that accurate 𝐵1 information is incorporated into the model [42],
[43]. This method can be extended to very low-field systems, as
recently demonstrated in Ref. [44] at 6.5 mT for in vivo breast

𝑇1 mapping, although the SNR drop limits the precision of the
method.
To enable simultaneous 𝑇1 mapping of hard and soft tissues,
this approach can be extended by replacing SPGR with a pair
of PETRA sequences with TR ≪𝑇1 and different nominal flip
angles (𝛼nom), hereafter referred to as VFA-PETRA. Because
PETRA maintains the gradients at a constant level after the
receive window, they act as effective spoilers of the transverse
magnetization, ensuring the establishment of an incoherent
steady state across all tissues. To minimize artifacts inherent
to this regime, several dummy pulses can be applied before the
repetitions in which data were acquired.
Unlike the SPDS strategy, in which the known and spatially
homogeneous 𝑇1 of a phantom is used to estimate 𝐵0(®𝑟) and
𝐵1(®𝑟) variations, VFA-PETRA exploits the fact that 𝐵0(®𝑟) and
𝐵1(®𝑟) are already known from a prior SPDS experiment. In this
case, 𝑇1(®𝑟) becomes the only spatially-varying unknown.
With the 𝜌𝛼1 and 𝜌𝛼2 reconstructions using PK of 𝐵0, the
noise background can be removed using a common mask applied
to both magnitude images. For all voxels within the mask, the
ratio
𝜆(®𝑟) = abs(𝜌𝛼1)
abs(𝜌𝛼2)
can be computed and solved for 𝑇1(®𝑟) according to the model:

experiment.
III. Methods
A. Scanner
All results have been obtained on a portable 90 mT MRI
system (𝜔L = 2𝜋· 3.64 MHz for 1H) designed for extremity and
brain imaging [12].
The magnet is based on an elliptical Halbach arrangement
constructed from Nd2Fe14B cubes (Fig. 1a) and incorporates
a shimming unit, resulting in a main field of ≈90 mT with
approximately 4,000 ppm over a sphere of 20 cm in diameter.
The compact design of the magnet (the bore has minor and
major axes of 𝑑m = 20 cm and 𝑑M = 28 cm, and a total axial
length of 𝑙= 44 cm) provides a high degree of portability while
still offering sufficient space to position the head within the FoV,
despite the spatial constraints imposed by the shoulders.
The gradient coils consist of three modules, each comprising
four concentric elliptical lobes manufactured from water-jetted
copper plates (Fig. 1a). The gradient coils have efficiencies of
(0.61, 0.87, 0.87) mT/m/A and resistances of (88, 128, 112) mΩ.
The coils are driven by three AE Techron 7224 power amplifiers
(Indiana, USA), which can deliver currents up to 50 A to the
loads, achieving maximum gradient strengths of (30.5, 43.5,
43.5) mT/m.
The RF system is based on a single solenoidal coil 15 cm
in length and diameter, wound with 44 turns of 2 mm copper
wire on a PLA holder (see Fig. 1b). The coil bandwidth was
≈260 kHz when loaded with a knee, corresponding to a quality
factor of 𝑄≈2501 (𝜏≈22 µs; see Fig. 2a). The RF low-noise
amplifier (45 dB gain, noise factor ≈1 dB) and power amplifier
(250 W, maximum duty cycle 10 % with 10 ms pulses), as well
as the passive Tx/Rx switch, were purchased from Barthel HF-
Technik GmbH (Aachen, Germany).
All components are housed within an aluminum structure
(Fig. 1c) measuring 68×95×140 cm3 (width × height × length)
and weighing 377 kg in total, allowing the system to be easily
moved. The device operates as a standalone unit and requires
only a connection to a standard single-phase power outlet.
During knee imaging experiments, the body acts as an
antenna [45], coupling significant amounts of electromagnetic
interference into the RF coil. To minimize this effect, the coil
and subject are partially covered with conductive cloth from
Holland Shielding Systems BV (Dordrecht, the Netherlands)
(Fig. 1d). All images were acquired with an RMS noise floor
below < 1.5× the expected thermal noise limit [46], with the RF
coil impedance matched to 50.0 ± 0.2 Ω at the daily operating
frequency.
The scanner is controlled through the open-source MaRCoS
(Magnetic Resonance Control System) framework [47], [48],
which features synchronized pulse-sequence execution and data
acquisition. User interaction with MaRCoS is handled via the
MaRGE interface (MaRCoS Graphical Environment) [49], and
all pulse sequences used in this work are openly available on
GitHub [50].
B. Pulse sequences
The pulse sequence parameters for all qualitative and quanti-
tative acquisitions are provided in Table I (PETRA) and Table II
(RARE).
C. System calibrations and PETRA optimization
To alleviate the effects of coil ringing and Tx/Rx switching
delays, we adopted the pre-emphasis and counter-emphasis
1The quality factor (𝑄) was determined from the time constant of the ring-
down signal (𝜏) following an RF pulse generated with a square input to the
RFPA. The magnetic field 𝐵1(𝑡) was recorded on an oscilloscope via flux
induction in a pickup loop near the RF coil (see Fig. 2a), and the decay envelope
was fitted to an exponential model.

approach proposed in Ref. [51]. In this scheme, the RF pulse is
composed of three consecutive components: (0) a short, high-
amplitude pre-emphasis pulse of the same phase as the main
excitation; (1) the main excitation pulse; and (2) a counter-
emphasis pulse of opposite phase (180° phase shift) that
suppresses residual energy stored in the resonator (see Fig. 2b).
This strategy effectively reduces post-transmission ringing2.
The impact of pre/counter-emphasis on RF pulse quality
(Sec. II-B) was evaluated by recording the 𝐵1(𝑡) field trace
on an oscilloscope using a small pickup coil (2 cm diameter,
2Not to be confused with a reduction in the intrinsic ring-down time constant,
which remains unchanged.
4 turns) positioned close to and approximately concentric with
the Tx/Rx coil. The voltage and duration configuration used
was 𝑉RF,0/𝑉RF,1/𝑉RF,2 = 1/0.25/1 a.u. and 𝑡RF,0/𝑡RF,1/𝑡RF,2 =
4/50/3 µs, corresponding respectively to the pre-, main-, and
counter-emphasis pulses. In the configuration without pre-
emphasis, only the main component was applied with 𝑉RF,1 =
0.25 a.u. and 𝑡RF,1 = 50 µs.
To prolong 𝑇∗
2 times (Sec. II-A), we shimmed actively
prior to each study, based on the line-narrowing of the free
NMR signal spectrum (see Fig. 3c). For this step, the pre-
emphasis configuration was 𝑉RF,0/𝑉RF,1/𝑉RF,2 = 1/0.25/1 a.u.
and 𝑡RF,0/𝑡RF,1/𝑡RF,2 = 3/25/3 µs.
To correct for slow Larmor-frequency drifts (Sec. II-C),


6
the carrier and demodulation frequencies were recalibrated at
intervals of no more than 10 minutes.
To keep acquisition times below 15 min (Sec. II-D), we
employed a moderate degree of radial undersampling (USrad up
to ×4). However, the pointwise region of 𝑘-space is always fully
acquired, as compressed sensing [52], [53] was suboptimal for
our context. Although the gradient system would tolerate longer
TRs without overheating, we limited the maximum TR to 50 ms.
D. Field maps
We followed the procedure introduced in Sec. II-F to obtain
simultaneous 𝐵0(®𝑟) and 𝐵1(®𝑟) maps in our 90 mT system, where
the Halbach magnet and the single, uniformly wound solenoidal
RF coil introduce significant fluctuations in both fields. The
three SPRITE sequences were applied to a structureless phantom
filled with a 1 % CuSO4 solution (TI = 8.6 ms, 𝑇1 = 12.5 ms,
measured by inversion recovery) that fully occupied the RF
imaging volume (see Fig. 1b).
Common parameters for the SPRITE sequences were: 𝑁av =
1, FoV = (20, 16, 16) cm, 𝑁= (20, 16, 16), Δ𝑟= 10 × 10 ×
10 mm3,𝑇1,d/𝑇2,d = 350/550 µs, 𝛼1,nom/𝛼2,nom = 60/80°, TR =
10 ms, BW = 50 kHz, 𝑁sp = 10,000, 𝑁dummy = 10, and 𝑇seq =
100 s, with a total protocol duration of 𝑇prot = 5 min.
For the first and third sequences, the different flip angles were
generated by increasing the nominal 𝐵1 strength while keeping
the RF pulse length (𝑡RF = 20 µs) and pre/counter-emphasis
identical in both cases, thereby avoiding relative modulations
due to differing excitation bandwidths. The three acquired 𝑘-
spaces were zero-padded by a factor of five to increase the spatial
resolution to 2 mm and subsequently reconstructed using FFT
to obtain the complex matrices 𝜌𝑖.
To estimate the spatially varying 𝐵1-scaling, we solved Eq. 5
for the value of 𝜂that minimizes the 𝐿2 norm of the discrepancy
between the analytical steady-state signal-ratio model (right-
hand side of Eq. 5) and the experimentally measured ratio at
each voxel (left-hand side), using in MATLAB a derivative-free
Nelder–Mead search (fminsearch) initialized at 𝜂=1 for all
pixels.
E. Standard relaxation maps
For the measurement of 𝑇2 in the soft tissues of the knee
following a standard approach (Sec. II-G), a series of RARE
images were acquired with TR ≫𝑇1. The echo time (TE) was
progressively varied in steps of 10 ms, from TE = 20 ms up to
100 ms, at which point the signal of all tissues became strongly
attenuated. For the measurement of 𝑇1, fourteen STIR images
were acquired with TR ≫𝑇1, varying the inversion time (TI)
from TI = 0 up to TI = 600 ms, where the signals of all tissues
were fully recovered from inversion.
In all cases, the filling of 𝑘-space followed a center-out
trajectory with 70 % partial Fourier sampling in the slice
direction. The 𝑘-spaces were FFT-reconstructed, and the noise
background was removed using a common mask applied to all
magnitude images. For each pixel within the mask, a voxelwise
fit to the appropriate relaxation model was performed. For the
𝑇2 map, the magnitude data |𝑠(TE)| was fitted to
𝑠(𝜌,𝑇2) = 𝜌𝑒−TE/𝑇2,
(9)
whereas the 𝑇1 map was obtained by fitting the magnitude data
|𝑠(TI)| to:
𝑠(𝜌,𝑇1) =
𝜌

1 −2𝑒−TI/𝑇1 + 𝑒−TR/𝑇1
 .
(10)
F. VFA-PETRA relaxation maps
Because the 𝑇1 mapping strategy described in Sec. II-H can
become imprecise when applied to anatomical regions that
protrude from the RF coil bore (such as the knee or elbow), we
first validated the method using the same homogeneous phantom
employed for field mapping, which fully occupied the imaging
volume (Fig. 1b).
This validation aimed to assess how the SNR of the resulting
𝑇1 maps depends on the nominal flip angles of the PETRA
pair used to compute 𝜆(®𝑟) in Eq. (8), and how this relationship
affects𝑇1 estimation accuracy and precision. Following phantom
validation, the VFA-PETRA method was applied for in vivo 𝑇1
mapping of the knee, simultaneously covering soft and hard
tissues in a healthy volunteer.
The RF pulses were systematically corrected by means
of pre/counter-emphasis, and the calibration of each 𝛼nom
was defined from Rabi flops obtained with increasing RF
amplitude and fixed pulse duration, ensuring identical excitation
bandwidths for both acquisitions.
For the in vivo case, two PETRA datasets were acquired
with a fixed TR = 50 ms and variable nominal flip an-
gles 𝛼1,nom/𝛼2,nom = 10/40° over Tseq = 6 min each. This
configuration produced a 3D 𝑇1 map with a resolution of
Δ𝑟= 2 × 2 × 4 mm3 in a total acquisition time of 12 min.
After the pair of PETRA acquisitions, the volunteer’s knee
was removed from the RF coil and replaced with the homo-
geneous phantom used for field mapping (Fig. 1b). After this
exchange, we readjusted the impedance matching. Subsequently,
the three SPRITE sequences described in Sec. II-F were
executed using the same active shimming settings as those
applied during the preceding in vivo PETRA scans.
G. Reconstruction and post-processing
Under ideal conditions, a radial-to-Cartesian interpolation
(with optional density compensation) followed by a model-
agnostic Fourier inversion can be an efficient strategy for non-
Cartesian 𝑘-space sampling. However, in non-ideal regimes a
more accurate approach is to construct a linear forward model
describing the system response to the applied pulse sequence,
incorporating prior knowledge of the relevant magnetic fields.
The resulting model defines a cost function that is minimized
(optionally with regularization) to solve the linear system of 𝑖
equations:
𝑠𝑖(𝑡) = EM𝑖, 𝑗(®𝑟, 𝑡) 𝜌𝑗(®𝑟),
(11)
where 𝑠𝑖is the vectorized 𝑘-space signal with a length equal to
the number of recorded samples during the sequence (𝑖), and
𝜌𝑗is the vectorized spin-density matrix with a size equal to the
number of voxels in the reconstructed image (𝑗). The matrix
EM𝑖, 𝑗represents a signal encoding matrix.
Once the Δ𝐵0(®𝑟) and Δ𝐵1(®𝑟) field maps have been estimated
from the SPDS protocol, the corresponding field matrices


7
(defined over the full imaging FoV) are cropped to the partial
imaging region and interpolated to match the target image
resolution. When reconstructing 𝑘-space data acquired with
a PETRA sequence at a given nominal flip angle 𝛼nom, the
voxelwise vectors Δ𝐵0(®𝑟𝑗) and 𝜂(®𝑟𝑗) are incorporated into the
non-ideal terms of the EM for each 𝑖-sample of 𝑘-space as
EM𝑖, 𝑗= 𝜖(®𝑟𝑗) · exp
n
−i
h
®𝑘𝑖· ®𝑟𝑗+ 𝛾Δ𝐵0(®𝑟𝑗) 𝑡(®𝑘𝑖)
io
,
(12)
where
𝜖(®𝑟𝑗) = sin 𝛼nom 𝜂(®𝑟𝑗)
sin(𝛼nom)
· 𝜂(®𝑟𝑗).
(13)
On the right-hand side of Eq. (13), the left fraction represents
the normalized FA experienced by each voxel during transmis-
sion, while 𝜂accounts for the receive sensitivity of the coil at
each voxel. In our PETRA acquisitions, 𝑡(®𝑘) = 𝑇d for the central
pointwise region, and 𝑡(®𝑘) = |®𝑘|/(𝛾|𝑔enc|) for the radial portion.
In RARE acquisitions, 𝑡(®𝑘) = |®𝑘rd|/(𝛾|𝑔rd|).
Finally, Eq. (11) is inverted using the Kaczmarz algorithm
(ART) [54], based on the recursive expression
𝜌𝑛= 𝜌𝑛−1 + 𝜆𝑠𝑖−EM𝑖· 𝜌𝑛−1
∥EM𝑖∥
EM∗
𝑖,
(14)
where 𝜆is a regularization parameter, 𝑠𝑖is the 𝑖th element of
the vectorized 𝑘-space data, EM𝑖is the 𝑖th row of the encoding
matrix, and 𝜌0 is typically initialized to zero. The estimated
solution 𝜌𝑛is updated 𝑛t × 𝑛it times via Eq. (14), where 𝑛it
denotes the number of ART iterations.
Except for the images shown in Fig. 6, which were simply
FFT-inverted, all PETRA and RARE images presented here
were reconstructed using ART with 𝐵0 and 𝐵1 PK. In all cases,
we used 𝜆= 𝑛it = 1. Except for the images in Figs. 4 and
5c–d (which are shown in raw form), all reconstructions were
denoised using a BM4D filter [55].
H. Tissue 𝑇1 estimations
Once the 3D 𝑇1 and 𝑇2 maps are obtained using either VFA-
PETRA or standard methods, a systematic procedure is followed
to extract the mean relaxation times for each tissue. First, a
representative 2D slice of the 3D map is selected, corresponding
to the region where the largest and most homogeneous portion
of the tissue of interest is visible and free of artifacts. This slice
is then segmented to generate a mask covering the homogeneous
region of that tissue. Finally, the mean value and standard
deviation of 𝑇1 and 𝑇2 are determined by fitting the histogram
of unmasked pixel values to Gaussian distributions.
IV. Results
A. System calibrations and PETRA optimization
The results presented below correspond to the calibration and
optimization procedures described in Section III-C.
Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the 𝐵1(𝑡) field in the
absence (a) and presence (b) of pre/counter-emphasis. Figure 2c
displays the corresponding frequency spectra of the blue traces
in panels a and b.
Figure 3 summarizes the calibration measurements performed
prior to each experiment once the RF coil was loaded with the
subject’s knee. Panel a shows a Rabi flop acquired by repeatedly
applying RF pulses (TR = 1 s) with pre/counter-emphasis and
linearly increasing amplitude. The first point of each recorded
FID, acquired 𝑇dead = 200 µs after switching off the RF pulse, is
plotted. Panels b and c show the FIDs and their respective FFTs
obtained without and with active shimming, after applying a
90° RF pulse (𝑡RF = 25 µs) with amplitude calibrated from
panel a. The optimized shimming reduced the linewidth to
88 ppm (FWHM = 320 Hz at 3.64 MHz). Panel d shows the
Larmor frequency drift measured during long PETRA and STIR
acquisitions in vivo (corresponding to Figs. 6b and 12a) and
during analogous phantom experiments.
Figure 4a illustrates the influence of the Tx/Rx switching
time (𝑇dead) and acquisition window (𝑇acq) on PETRA recon-
structions. From left to right, the ratio 𝑇dead/𝑇acq varies around
the optimal value found for this phantom, set to 200 µs/1 ms.
Figure 4b shows the impact of radial 𝑘-space undersampling
(USrad). As USrad increases from ×1 to ×16, the sequence
duration shortens at the expense of nominal resolution. Figure 4c
shows the artifacts caused by RF pulse length (𝑡RF) in PETRA
images acquired with |𝑔enc| = 6 mT/m and a bandwidth 38 kHz.
From left to right, 𝑡RF increases as 5, 20, 50, 150, and 300 µs,
corresponding to spectral bandwidths of 240, 60, 24, 8, and
4 kHz, respectively.
B. Field maps and model-based reconstruction
The results presented here correspond to the procedures
described in Section III-D (field mapping) and Section III-G
(reconstruction).
Figures 5a and b show, respectively, the Δ𝐵0(®𝑟) and 𝜂(®𝑟) maps
obtained using the SPDS protocol for several 𝑧-slices across
the FoV. Figures 5c and d compare agnostic and model-based
reconstructions of the same PETRA 𝑘-space data acquired from
a gridded phantom filled with a 1 % CuSO4 solution.
C. Standard relaxation maps
The results presented below correspond to the standard
procedures described in Section III-E for 𝑇1 and 𝑇2 mapping.
Figure 6a shows a representative slice from a series of nine
3D RARE images of a healthy volunteer’s knee, acquired with
echo times ranging from 10 ms to 100 ms. Figure 6b shows the
same slice from a series of fourteen 3D STIR images acquired
in another healthy volunteer, with inversion times ranging from
0 ms to 600 ms. Figures 6c and d display the corresponding 𝑇2
and 𝑇1 maps of the knee’s soft tissues, obtained by voxelwise
fitting of the signal variation with TE and TI according to
Eqs. (9) and (10), respectively.
D. Phantom validation of VFA-PETRA relaxation maps
The results presented below correspond to procedures de-
scribed in Section III-F.
Figure 7 shows the phantom-based validation of the VFA-
PETRA approach for 𝑇1 mapping, evaluating its reliability as
a function of: (i) the nominal flip angles used for the PETRA
sequence pair; and (ii) the inclusion or omission of 𝐵0 and 𝐵1
PK in the fitting model.

Figure 7a displays the central 𝑧-slice from a set of nine PETRA
images (𝜌𝑖, 𝑖= 1 . . . 9) acquired with nominal flip angles
varying from 𝛼1,nom = 10° to 𝛼9,nom = 90° in 10° increments.
All images were reconstructed with ART using only 𝐵0 PK in
the encoding matrix.
Figure 7b shows the corresponding ratio maps 𝜆𝑖(®𝑟) =
abs(𝜌𝑖)/abs(𝜌1) (𝑖= 2 . . . 9) computed for the same slice.
Figure 7c presents the𝑇1 maps obtained from each𝜆𝑖by fitting
Eq. (8) under the assumption of negligible field inhomogeneities
(Δ𝐵0 = 0, 𝜂= 1). Figure 7d shows the corresponding 𝑇1
histograms derived from these maps.
Figure 7e displays the 𝑇1 maps obtained from the same ratios
when including the Δ𝐵0 and 𝜂maps estimated from SPDS as PK
in the fitting model. Finally, Figure 7f shows the 𝑇1 histograms
corresponding to these corrected maps.
E. In vivo imaging of hard tissues
The results presented here correspond to the PETRA se-
quences detailed in Table I, after applying the optimizations
and calibrations described in the previous subsections.
Figure 8 shows reconstructions of 𝑘-space data acquired
for the knee and ankle of a healthy volunteer. For consistent
visualization across all three anatomical planes, an isotropic
spatial resolution of 2 mm was selected, despite the associated
penalty in SNR and scan time.
Figure 9 compares the visualization capabilities of PETRA
with those of standard clinical MRI sequences (PD-, 𝑇1-,
and 𝑇2-weighted RARE) for both the knee and ankle. Below
each anatomical slice, the corresponding SNR map is shown,
normalized per unit of scan time and displayed using a common
color scale.
Figure 10 shows the same 𝑧-slice of a healthy volunteer’s knee,
encoded with equivalent PETRA sequences differing only in FA
and TR. The number of averages was fixed for each acquisition
to maintain a constant total scan duration (8.4 min).
Figure 11 shows slices from four 3D datasets obtained by
subtracting PETRA images acquired with fixed TR = 50 ms and
variable flip angles ranging between 10° and 150°. Figure 11a
corresponds to 𝛼2 −𝛼1 = 120◦−50◦, highlighting the cruciate
ligament (red arrow). Figure 11b corresponds to 𝛼2 −𝛼1 =
150◦−90◦, enhancing fat relative to muscle (green arrow).

fields (Eq. (11) with Δ𝐵0(®𝑟𝑗) = 0 and 𝜖(®𝑟𝑗) = 1) from a grid phantom encoded with PETRA. (d) Same slices reconstructed with ART including PK of both
𝐵0(®𝑟) and 𝐵1(®𝑟), using the same PETRA sequence as in (c).

Figure 11c corresponds to 𝛼2−𝛼1 = 70◦−20◦, showing complete
fat suppression and muscle enhancement (blue arrow). Finally,
Figure 11d corresponds to 𝛼2 −𝛼1 = 30◦−10◦, emphasizing
cartilage and meniscus (purple arrow).
F. In vivo relaxation maps of hard tissues
The results presented below correspond to methods described
in Section III-F and validated as shown in Section IV-D.
Figure 12 shows the results of 3D 𝑇1 mapping performed
with VFA-PETRA on the knee of a healthy volunteer. Figure 12a
displays four representative slices from a 3D PETRA acquisition
encompassing the main tissues of interest. This image was gen-
erated using PETRA parameters equivalent to those employed
for the pair of images used to compute 𝜆(®𝑟) in Eq. (8), except for
the flip angle, which was set to 90° to enhance tissue contrast
and facilitate automatic segmentation.
Figure 12b shows the segmentation of short-𝑇2 tissues in
the same slices, from which the mean 𝑇1 value for each region
was subsequently determined. The segmented structures include
the posterior cruciate ligament (sky blue), quadriceps tendon
(green), patellar tendon (red), cortical bone (purple), auricular
cartilage (dark blue), and patellar cartilage (gray). For com-
parison with standard methods, two predominant soft tissues
(muscle and fat, shown in orange and yellow, respectively) were
also included.
Figure 12c presents the corresponding 𝑇1 maps for the
same slices, obtained from 𝜆(®𝑟) computed using a pair of
PETRA images with nominal flip angles 𝛼1,nom/𝛼2,nom = 10/40,
followed by voxelwise fitting to Eq. (5). Finally, Figure 12d
shows the 𝑇1 distributions within each RoI together with their
Gaussian fits, from which the mean 𝑇1 values for each tissue
were estimated.
V. Discussion
A. System calibrations and PETRA optimization
Figure 2a shows the distortion of the RF pulse relative to
the expected rectangular shape. In this case, the charging and
discharging of energy in the resonator extend up to 𝜏≈22 µs
due to the low operating frequency (𝜔L = 2𝜋·3.64 MHz) and the
high quality factor (𝑄≈250) of the RF coil. However, Figure 2b
demonstrates that this distortion can be effectively compensated
by incorporating pre-emphasis, while the counter-emphasis
reduces spurious energy stored in the resonator. Figure 2c further
shows that the application of pre/counter-emphasis enables a
more uniform excitation of a 24 kHz spectral bandwidth.
In Figure 3a, the uncertainty in flip-angle calibration derived
from a Rabi flop is evident, originating from 𝐵1 inhomo-
geneities. This manifests as a non-zero signal at 𝐵1 = 0.35 a.u.,
corresponding to the 𝜋-pulse condition. Figures 3b and c show
that active shimming extends the raw FID up to𝑇∗
2 ≈1 ms, while
narrowing the spectral width to 320 Hz (88 ppm). The Larmor
frequency drift observed across different studies (Fig. 3d)
supports two conclusions: (i) the PETRA sequences used in
this study do not induce greater heating than the RARE/STIR
sequences;and (ii)thedriftin Larmorfrequencyis mainlydriven
by heat transferred from the subject to the magnet, as well as

the sensitivity of the permanent magnets to ambient conditions.
During in vivo knee experiments, a maximum frequency shift
of 650 Hz was recorded after 110 min of consecutive sequences,
all performed under identical gradient conditions.
Figure 4a reveals that excessively short 𝑇dead values produce
artifacts in the form of a central lobe resembling a sinc function,
caused by residual ring-down energy. The required dead time
depends primarily on the signal amplitude, which varies with the
size of the anatomical region, as well as with image resolution,
TR, and FA. When 𝑇acq > 𝑇∗
2 ≈1 ms, blurring, anisotropic
resolution loss, geometric distortions, and hyperintense banding
appear as a consequence of incorrect spin mapping induced by
𝐵0(®𝑟) inhomogeneities. Unlike 𝑇dead, this limit is intrinsic to
the system, since 𝑇∗
2 is mainly determined by the distribution
of Larmor frequencies within the imaging volume. For these
reasons, while𝑇acq was fixed at 1.25 ms for in vivo imaging,𝑇dead
was adjusted from 175 µs (knee) to 300 µs (ankle), reflecting the
lower signal amplitude in the latter.
Figure 4b illustrates that reducing the number of radial
readouts in 𝑘-space leads to a loss of nominal resolution, which
is less noticeable in highly structured phantoms such as the one
used here. We found that undersampling up to a factor of ×4
remains acceptable for large anatomical structures, introducing
only minor degradation in fine details.
Finally, Figure 4c shows that extending the RF pulse in ZTE
introduces two distinct effects: (i) the non-uniform spectral
coverage of long pulses produces a sinc-like radial modulation
of brightness in the phantom, as peripheral regions are less
efficiently excited; and (ii) the spectral selectivity of long pulses
under a gradient field promotes adiabatic-like excitation, intro-
ducing a relative time-origin shift in 𝑘(𝑡) between isochromats.
This effect results in image blurring in regions where spins are
significantly detuned from the RF carrier frequency.
B. Field maps and model-based reconstruction
Figures 5a and b demonstrate the capability of the SPDS
extension to generate simultaneous 𝐵0(®𝑟) and 𝐵1(®𝑟) maps that
are free from geometric distortions. In the resulting maps, the
expected 𝐵1 modulation toward the edges of the solenoidal
coil and the characteristic high-order field components of the
Halbach magnet are markedly visible.
Figure 5c shows the types of artifacts typically observed in
PETRA reconstructions when field-agnostic methods are ap-
plied.These includegeometric distortions,pronouncedblurring,
and complete signal loss in regions most affected by strong 𝐵0
inhomogeneity.
In contrast, Figure 5d shows a substantial reduction of these
artifacts when PK of both 𝐵0(®𝑟) and 𝐵1(®𝑟) is incorporated
into the EM within the ART reconstruction, demonstrating the
advantage of the model-based approach.
C. Phantom validation of VFA-PETRA relaxation maps
Figure 7 validates the VFA-PETRA approach for 𝑇1 quan-
tification in tissues with short 𝑇2. As shown in Figure 7b,
increasing the difference between the nominal flip angles of the
PETRA image pair enhances the SNR of the 𝜆(®𝑟) map, thereby
improving the robustness of the 𝑇1 estimation. However, this

each tissue type. (c) Resulting 𝑇1 maps for the same slices. (d) 𝑇1 distribution within each segmented RoI and corresponding Gaussian fits for mean 𝑇1 estimation.
also amplifies the effects of 𝐵0 and 𝐵1 fluctuations, which in
turn demand accurate field mapping via SPDS.
Figure 7c illustrates that, when 𝜆(®𝑟) maps with large FA
separations are used to generate 𝑇1 maps without accounting
for field inhomogeneities in Eq. (8), the resulting 𝑇1 map
exhibits good SNR but deviates substantially from the expected
homogeneous distribution of this phantom. Such bias could
compromise the precision of 𝑇1 estimates for tissues located
away from the coil center in in vivo VFA-PETRA applications.
Conversely, when a small FA difference is selected, the low
SNR reduces the apparent 𝐵1(®𝑟)-related inhomogeneity in the
resulting 𝑇1 map, but the estimation becomes unreliable due to
insufficient signal contrast.
Finally, Figure 7d shows that, when PK of both 𝐵0 and 𝐵1
fields is incorporated into Eq. (8) and a large 𝜆(®𝑟) map is used,
the resulting 𝑇1 distribution becomes spatially homogeneous
across the entire phantom while retaining SNR. This improve-
ment, which stems from the inclusion of 𝐵0 and 𝐵1 PK and the
choice of sufficiently separated nominal flip angles, is reflected
in the mean values and standard deviations of the Gaussian fits
displayed in Figures 7e and f.
D. In vivo imaging of hard tissues
The slices shown in Figure 8 highlight several hard-tissue
structures exhibiting non-zero signal intensity in the PETRA
reconstructions. In the knee, identifiable structures include
the anterior (yellow) and posterior (red) cruciate ligaments,
patellar cartilage (blue), cortical bone (green), quadriceps
tendon (brown), patellar ligament (white), fibular collateral
ligament (orange), and the medial (pink) and lateral (black)
menisci. A Baker’s cyst (purple) appears dark due to its long
𝑇1 (greater than 1 s) compared with the short repetition time
used (TR = 20 ms). In the ankle slices, distinct structures can be
identified, such as the Achilles tendon (red), peroneus longus
tendon (yellow), tibialis anterior tendon (green), posterior
tibiofibular ligament (orange), tibialis posterior tendon (brown),
and flexor hallucis tendon (white). It is worth noting that the
circular and vertical halos visible in the axial and coronal/sagittal
planes, respectively, are not artifacts intrinsic to the PETRA
sequence, but rather correspond to the PLA holder used for the
RF coil winding.
Figure 9 compares the performance of PETRA against RARE
sequences (PD-weighted, 𝑇1-weighted, and 𝑇2-weighted) for
imaging the knee and ankle. In the knee slices, the image in
Figure 9a contains the largest extent of the anterior cruciate
ligament (red), while Figure 9b highlights the patellar tendon
(green), patellar cartilage (red), and lateral meniscus (yellow). In
the ankle, Figure 9c shows the slice containing the widest portion
of the Achilles tendon (red) and posterior talofibular ligament
(yellow), whereas Figure 9d displays the peroneus longus tendon
(blue).
A comparison of the SNR maps (normalized per unit of scan
time and shown below each image) reveals that PETRA achieves
substantial SNR in regions where RARE sequences show little
or no signal. Among the RARE variants, PD-weighted imaging
provides the closest performance to PETRA, since shorter
TE and ETL values combined with longer TRs improve the
detectability of tissues with short 𝑇2, long 𝑇1, and low proton
density.
Figure 10 illustrates the dependence of tissue contrast and
SNR efficiency in PETRA on flip angle and repetition time.
According to the Ernst equation, the maximum SNR for fat
and muscle (assuming an average 𝑇1 = 150 ms) occurs at 𝛼≈
30° for TR = 25 ms and at 𝛼≈60° for TR = 100 ms. However,
as in steady-state spin-echo sequences, the most efficient SNR
performance is achieved at the shortest possible TR when the
FA is adjusted close to the corresponding Ernst angle (in our
case, TR = 25 ms and 𝛼= 40°).
Figure 11 demonstrates the effectiveness of applying VFA
strategies in PETRA imaging to modulate tissue contrast in
a controlled and predictable manner. By selecting appropriate
pairs of flip angles, preferential contrast enhancement can be
achieved between specific structures, as illustrated in each
subfigure: cruciate ligament, fat, muscle, cartilage, and meniscus
are selectively highlighted depending on the chosen flip-
angle combination. This targeted contrast notably improves the
anatomical delineation achievable with ZTE, which is otherwise
largely limited to PD- or 𝑇1-weighted contrast. Simultaneously,
acquiring two PETRA images with calibrated flip angles enables
the subsequent computation of𝑇1 relaxation maps (see Fig. 12c),
thereby integrating qualitative contrast manipulation and quan-
titative relaxometry within a single acquisition framework. This
underscores both the versatility and the potential diagnostic
value of combining PETRA with VFA, in contrast to traditional
inversion-recovery approaches.


13
E. In vivo relaxation maps of soft and hard tissues
From the analysis of the data in Figures 6c and d, and
according to Eqs. (9) and (10), the muscle exhibits relaxation
times of 𝑇1 = 189 ± 16 ms and 𝑇2 = 35 ± 5 ms, while fat
shows 𝑇1 = 128 ± 11 ms and 𝑇2 = 69 ± 7 ms. These values
are consistent with those reported in Ref. [35] at 50 mT, who
measured 𝑇1 = 183 ± 10 ms and 𝑇2 = 41 ± 3 ms for muscle, and
𝑇1 = 134 ± 7 ms and 𝑇2 = 104 ± 10 ms for fat. As expected,
this conventional approach yields highly reliable 𝑇1 and 𝑇2
estimates for soft tissues, although it remains time-consuming
and impractical for routine clinical use. Nonetheless, it provides
a valuable reference for assessing the accuracy of the 𝑇1 values
obtained using VFA-PETRA.
Figure 7 demonstrates the capability of VFA-PETRA to
generate 𝑇1 maps of short-𝑇2 phantoms (𝑇2 ≈5 ms), which
are inaccessible using standard relaxation mapping techniques.
However, it is essential to include 𝐵1(®𝑟) information in the
theoretical model to ensure robust estimation. As shown in
Figure 7c, neglecting 𝐵1 fluctuations results in inhomogeneous
𝑇1 maps that mirror the 𝐵1 efficiency distribution, leading to
strong bias and poor precision in Gaussian fits. Conversely,
when 𝐵1 PK is incorporated (Figure 7d), the 𝑇1 maps display
homogeneous distributions, and the fitted values match the
expected reference with smaller uncertainties. This result further
validates the SPDS extension for 𝐵1 mapping.
The analysis of the data in Figure 12c, according to Eq. (8),
provides the estimated 𝑇1 values for the different soft and hard
tissues in the knee, summarized in the titles of Figure 12d. The
mean 𝑇1 values obtained for muscle and fat with VFA-PETRA
agree, within experimental error, with those derived from
standard methods, confirming the reliability of the proposed
approach. However, it was not possible to quantify the 𝑇1 times
of the smallest short-𝑇2 tissues, such as the meniscus, due to
insufficient segmentation accuracy.
VI. Conclusion
In this work, we have demonstrated that it is possible to
broaden the range of pulse sequences applicable to portable,
low-cost MRI systems based on Halbach magnets. Specifically,
we have implemented and optimized a ZTE-like PETRA
sequence capable of producing images with clinically acceptable
resolution and SNR within acquisition times below 15 min
at 𝐵0 ≈90 mT. This achievement significantly extends the
diagnostic reach of such portable systems, enabling the visual-
ization of hard tissues (including ligaments, tendons, cartilage,
and bone) that are largely suppressed in conventional spin-
echo acquisitions. The feasibility of in vivo PETRA imaging
was demonstrated on knees and ankles of healthy volunteers,
establishing, to our knowledge, the first proof of ZTE imaging
in a Halbach-based MRI system. Clinically, this capability holds
promise for musculoskeletal assessment, therapy monitoring,
and longitudinal follow-up in both radiological and point-of-
care environments, offering a non-ionizing alternative to X-rays
for bone and ligament evaluation.
To achieve artifact-free PETRA reconstructions under the
strong field inhomogeneities characteristic of Halbach systems,
a set of dedicated calibration and correction procedures was
developed. These include the use of pre/counter-emphasis pulses
to minimize RF ring-down energy and reduce Tx/Rx switching
time, thereby improving the temporal efficiency and SNR of
the sequence without extending scan duration or computational
demand. Furthermore, we introduced an extension of the SPDS
protocol that enables simultaneous mapping of 𝐵0(®𝑟) and 𝐵1(®𝑟)
in under 5 min. This calibration, which can be performed entirely
with a phantom outside the patient workflow, was found essential
for accurate model-based reconstruction, as 𝐵0 PK proved
critical for mitigating geometric distortions. In contrast, 𝐵1 PK,
while not mandatory for qualitative imaging, was shown to be
crucial for accurate quantitative mapping.
Using these calibrations, we validated the VFA-PETRA
approach for quantitative 𝑇1 mapping in both phantoms and
in vivo in human knees. This method enables, for the first
time, the estimation of 𝑇1 in hard tissues with 𝑇2 < 1 ms
at 𝐵0 < 0.1 T, extending quantitative MRI capabilities into
regimes previously inaccessible to portable scanners. Although
the technique provides accurate results, its precision remains
limited by the intrinsically low SNR of low-field MRI, the coarse
spatial resolution required for clinically acceptable scan times,
and the small physical dimensions and low proton density of
hard tissues. These constraints amplify partial-volume effects
and reduce segmentation reliability, particularly for ligaments
and cartilage. Similar challenges have been reported in other
low-field VFA implementations [44], underscoring the need for
further optimization of both sequence parameters and hardware
sensitivity.
Despite these limitations, the present work establishes a solid
foundation for quantitative and structural MRI at very low field.
Thedemonstrated combinationofPETRA imaging,pre/counter-
emphasis, and SPDS-based field mapping constitutes a versatile
framework for robust imaging in portable Halbach systems.
Future work will focus on improving SNR through optimized
RF coils and reconstruction algorithms, refining VFA-PETRA
for higher precision in 𝑇1 estimation, and exploring strategies
to measure 𝑇2 and 𝑇∗
2 in hard tissues. The latter is currently
unfeasible with PETRA but potentially achievable through mod-
ified ZTE or multi-echo variants. Together, these advances could
further extend the clinical reach of portable MRI, providing safe,
accessible, and comprehensive imaging for musculoskeletal
applications in both clinical and remote settings.
Disclosures
The tissue identification presented in Figures 8 and 9
was performed by the authors without input from certified
radiological specialists. Consequently, certain structures in the
images may have been incorrectly associated with anatomical
tissues of the human atlas. It is not our intention to mislead
or confuse expert readers, nor to attribute undue interpretative
significance to these identifications. For anatomical comparison
and tissue labeling, reference was made to the online knee atlas
available at https://freitasrad.net/pages/atlas/Knee/knee.php.
