Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into
users’ daily lives, driving a growing demand for personalized out-
puts. Prior work has primarily leveraged a user’s own history, often
overlooking inter-user differences that are critical for effective per-
sonalization. While recent methods have attempted to model such
differences, their feature extraction processes typically rely on fixed
dimensions and quick, intuitive inference (System-1 thinking), lim-
iting both the coverage and granularity of captured user differences.
To address these limitations, we propose Difference-aware Reasoning
Personalization (DRP), a framework that reconstructs the difference
extraction mechanism by leveraging inference scaling to enhance
LLM personalization. DRP autonomously identifies relevant dif-
ference feature dimensions and generates structured definitions
and descriptions, enabling slow, deliberate reasoning (System-2
thinking) over user differences. Experiments on personalized re-
view generation demonstrate that DRP consistently outperforms
baseline methods across multiple metrics.

Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across real-world applications—such as virtual assistants [2], con-
tent creation [17], and scientific discovery [20]—driven by their
powerful capabilities in context comprehension, generation, and
reasoning [3, 21]. However, existing LLMs are generally built fol-
lowing a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm [9], failing to account for
the variability in user preferences. As the demand for delivering
tailored and engaging experiences grows, interest in LLM personal-
ization has steadily increased across both academic and industrial
domains [8, 16], aiming to tailor model outputs based on user-
specific information.
Most existing works on LLM personalization adopt the memory-
retrieval paradigm [15, 18], where user history is stored in memory,
and key information is then retrieved as instructional contexts to
customize model responses. Early approaches focused exclusively
on leveraging information about the individual user for personaliza-
tion [7, 11]. More recent works, such as DPL [13], emphasize that ef-
fective personalization requires identifying the differences between
users that shape individual preferences, an insight supported by re-
search in psychology and behavioral science [5]. Accordingly, DPL
selects representative users for comparison, extracts task-relevant
differences, and incorporates them as augmented features within
prompts to improve personalization.
Despite demonstrated effectiveness of DPL, we argue that its
difference extraction mechanism remains inherently limited in both
the coverage and granularity of generated features. In terms of cov-
erage, the extracted differences are restricted to fixed, pre-defined
feature dimensions (writing, emotional, and semantic style), mak-
ing it challenging to capture the potentially unbounded space of
user preferences [8]. Regarding granularity, the mechanism relies
on quick inference learned at training time (also referred to as
System-1 thinking) [6], and therefore lacks the capability to deeply
analyze fine-grained patterns that may be critical, such as the under-
lying causes driving the observed differences [10]. Consequently,
in dynamic personalization scenarios, it is desirable to leverage
the advanced reasoning capabilities at inference time (System-2
thinking), enabling on-the-fly reasoning to uncover richer and more
informative difference features.

Suyu Chen et al.
To address these limitations, we propose reconstructing DPL’s
difference extraction mechanism by incorporating additional test-
time computation to enable flexible feature dimensions and ex-
tended reasoning chains. This approach is inspired by the success
of inference scaling in math [19] and coding [22] tasks. First, by
enabling flexible dimension generation, the model can more thor-
oughly explore the user preference space, alleviating the constraints
imposed by handcrafted dimensions. Second, by allowing sophis-
ticated reasoning, the model can produce fine-grained rationales,
offering deeper insights into user differences. Together, this opens
up the possibility of scaling both the coverage and granularity of
generated difference features in a training-free manner, thereby
capturing a broader spectrum of user preferences.
To this end, we propose Difference-aware Reasoning Personaliza-
tion (DRP), a novel framework that enhances LLM personalization
through inference scaling. Specifically, DRP leverages reasoning-
enhanced LLMs as the difference extractor: it first autonomously
identifies the appropriate feature dimensions for generating differ-
ences, and then provides clear definitions and descriptions for each
dimension. This design provides a natural entry point for the model
to transition from quick, intuitive inference (System-1 thinking) to
slow, deliberate reasoning (System-2 thinking), thereby enabling
scalable personalization. We compare DRP’s performance using
reasoning-enhanced models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen [3]) versus
standard instruction-tuned models (Qwen2.5-Instruct [14]) across
parameter sizes from 1.5B to 32B, on the representative personaliza-
tion task of review generation, following prior studies [12, 13, 23].
Across these settings, DRP consistently outperforms baselines, with
reasoning-enhanced LLMs achieving gains of up to 23.0% on key
metrics such as BLEU, and quantitative analyses provide empir-
ical validation that these improvements stem from both broader
coverage and enhanced granularity of user difference features.
The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore inference
scaling to overcome limitations of existing LLM personalization
methods, including restricted coverage and limited granularity
in capturing user differences.
• We propose DRP, which autonomously determine difference fea-
ture dimensions and generate structured definitions and descrip-
tions through extended reasoning, facilitating scalable difference
features for personalization.
• We conduct a series of experiments, showcasing the effectiveness
of DRP in LLM personalization.

Methodology
2.1
Task Formulation
LLM personalization aims to generate content that reflects a user’s
individual preferences. In this work, we focus on personalized re-
view generation [13]. Each user has historical texts—either written
or preferred by them—that capture their personal style and pref-
erences. Let D denote the historical dataset with samples (𝑢,𝑖,𝑦),
where 𝑢is a user, 𝑖an item, and 𝑦the user-associated text. Given
a target user 𝑢and item 𝑖, the objective is to generate a personal-
ized review ˆ𝑦that aligns with the user’s historical texts. Following
standard retrieval-based personalization [16], the target user’s key
historical data D★
𝑢can be retrieved as contextual input, forming

(1)
which serves as the foundation upon which DRP builds.
2.2
DRP Framework
We propose DRP, a framework for difference-aware user modeling
that enhances personalization via automatic dimension discovery
and reasoning-based feature extraction.
Step 0: Representative User Selection. To extract meaningful
differences, DRP selects multiple users R for comparison. Users
are clustered using K-means based on their historical text embed-
dings, and for a target user 𝑢, 𝑀representatives are chosen from
all clusters excluding 𝑢’s own:
R = {𝑟1,𝑟2, . . . ,𝑟𝑀}.
(2)
Step 1: Reasoning-based Difference Extraction. Unlike prior
work like DPL [13], which relies on fixed, handcrafted feature di-
mensions and rapid System-1 inference, DRP combines automatic
dimension discovery with deliberate reasoning in a single step. The
reasoning-enhanced extractor LLM𝑅
𝐸identifies relevant difference
dimensions Δauto and analyzes the underlying factors driving the
differences between the target user and each representative:
{𝛿𝑢,𝑟= LLM𝑅
𝐸(D★
𝑢, D★
𝑟, Δauto) | 𝑟∈R}.
(3)
This produces structured definitions and descriptions, enabling
scalable difference features for personalization.
Step 2: Reflective Validation. The extracted difference features
are independently verified by a reflection-enabled LLM, which
filters out invalid or spurious differences. Formally:
{ ˜𝛿𝑢,𝑟}𝑟∈R = LLM𝑉({𝛿𝑢,𝑟}𝑟∈R),
(4)
where LLM𝑉denotes the LLM performing the validation (defaulting
to the same model as LLM𝐸).
Step 3: Personalized Generation. The validated difference
features { ˜𝛿𝑢,𝑟}𝑟∈R and the target user’s key history D★
𝑢are jointly
summarized by the summarizer LLM𝑆and used by the generator
LLM𝐺to produce the final personalized review:
ˆ𝑦= LLM𝐺

Experiment
In this section, we conduct experiments to answer the following
research questions:
RQ1: Does DRP outperform baseline methods in personalized text
generation when leveraging inference scaling?
RQ2: Does DRP improve the coverage and granularity of difference
extraction to enhance personalization performance?
3.1
Experimental Setup
Datasets. Building upon prior work [16], we focus on the repre-
sentative task of item review generation for LLM personalization.
Specifically, we utilize the Amazon Reviews dataset [4] prepro-
cessed by DPL [13], which includes the Books and CDs & Vinyl.
Baselines. We compare DRP with the following methods: (1) Non-
personalized approach: Non-P ; (2) RAG-based variants: RAG [16],
IntSum [15], LLM-TRSR [24], CICL [1], P-DB [18] ; (3) Difference-
aware method: DPL [13].
Evaluation Metrics. Following previous works on personalized
text generation [12, 13], we evaluate all methods using BLEU, ME-
TEOR, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L.
Implementation Details. In DRP, the difference extraction is per-
formed using reasoning-enhanced (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen [3])
and standard (Qwen2.5-Instruct [14]) models across 1.5B to 32B
parameter scales. For each model, experiments are conducted at
temperatures 0 and 0.8, with results averaged. The remaining config-
urations are consistent with DPL. Due to space limitations, details
regarding the datasets, baselines, and prompts used in the experi-
ments are provided in the repository1.
3.2
Main Result (RQ1)
Comparison results of the overall performance are presented in
Table 1, from which the following observations can be drawn:
Superior Performance. DRP consistently outperforms all base-
lines on both datasets after scaling to 14B parameters (the default
in DPL), demonstrating that the inference scaling of difference ex-
tractor significantly improves personalized generation quality, with
a maximum BLEU gain of 23.0% on Books.
Scaling and Reasoning Effects. DRP’s performance improves
with larger model sizes, reflecting the benefits of increased capac-
ity. At the same extractor size, DeepSeek outperforms Qwen in
most cases, likely due to its reasoning-enhanced design, which en-
ables finer-grained extraction of user-specific differences and richer
contextual information for personalized generation.
3.3
Qualitative Analysis (RQ2)
3.3.1
Coverage Analysis. We propose a metric to quantify the cov-
erage of generated difference features. Based on a posterior analysis,
we categorize the features into five representative types: Writing,
Emotion, Semantics, Structure, and Pragmatics. The first two cap-
ture surface-level tendencies, while the latter three reflect deeper
cognitive and communicative patterns.
A difference feature is considered valid if it is comparative (re-
flecting the target relative to others), atomic (capturing a single
property), clear (unambiguous), categorized (belonging to one of

the five predefined types), and consistent (directionally stable across
multiple sources). For each user, we deduplicate valid features and
remove conflicting directional terms. Aggregating the remaining
unique valid features across the dataset gives the Unique Valid
Quantity (UVQ). A higher UVQ indicates that the model captures a
broader and more diverse set of difference features, reflecting better
coverage of potential user differences.
We evaluate these features using Qwen-2.5-Instruct-32B via in-
context learning. Figure 2 shows the relationship between BLEU
and UVQ across different extractor models on the Books dataset.
A significant positive correlation can be observed between BLEU
and UVQ, indicating that one source of improvement in our pro-
posed method stems from an increased number of unique valid
differential features, which validates the necessity of overcoming
the limitations imposed by handcrafted feature dimensions.
3.3.2
Granularity Analysis. Then, we analyze the granularity of the
difference features. We report the proportions of the five dimension
categories described above across different extractor models, as
shown in Figure 3. It is evident that the stronger DeepSeek variants
exhibit higher proportions in Semantics, Structure, and Pragmat-
ics, suggesting that reasoning allows the model to capture deeper
cognitive patterns during thinking processing, rather than merely
surface-level tendencies. Additionally, we present a case study in
Table 2, which demonstrates that the reasoning process can gen-
erate analyses of the underlying causes driving user differences,
thereby uncovering rare but valuable personalized features.

Conclusion
We proposed DRP to enhance LLM personalization by leveraging
inference scaling. DRP autonomously identified flexible difference
