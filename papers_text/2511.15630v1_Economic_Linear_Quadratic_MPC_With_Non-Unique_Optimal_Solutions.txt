Abstract
Asymptotic stability in economic receding horizon control can be obtained under a strict dissipativity assumption, related to
positive-definiteness of a so-called rotated cost, and through the use of suitable terminal cost and constraints. In the linear-
quadratic case, a common assumption is that the rotated cost is positive definite. The positive semi-definite case has received
surprisingly little attention, and the connection to the standard dissipativity assumption has not been investigated. In this
paper, we fill this gap by connecting existing results in economic model predictive control with the stability results for the
semi-definite case, the properties of the constrained generalized discrete algebraic Riccati equation, and of two optimal control
problems. Moreover, we extend recent results relating exponential stability to the choice of terminal cost in the absence of
terminal constraints.

Introduction
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a control technique
in which a finite-horizon Optimal Control Problem
(OCP) is solved at each time step. The first optimal
control input is applied, the next state is measured, and
the OCP is solved again in order to update the optimal
control input in a receding horizon fashion [1,2].
While the stability theory typically assumes that the
cost function has its minimum at the optimal steady
state, in economic MPC (EMPC) generic costs are al-
lowed. While this allows one to potentially improve
closed-loop performance, providing asymptotic stability
guarantees becomes much harder and typically requires
some strict dissipativity assumption to hold [3]. Early
results include [4,5], where the main idea was first pre-
sented. Necessity of strict dissipativity has been proven
in [6]. Stability in the absence of terminal constraints
has been analyzed in [7–11]. The periodic case has been
analyzed in [12,13] and the discounted case has been
studied in [14,15]. Computationally efficient algorithms
tailored to EMPC have been proposed in [16–19].

The linear-quadratic case has been analyzed in [20–23],
where the use of a quadratic positive-definite cost has
also been proposed to formulate tracking MPC so as to
approximate EMPC. While a positive-definite rotated
cost is assumed in these works, the relaxation of that as-
sumption has received less attention. The only work we
are aware of, which only assumes that the rotated stage
cost is positive semi-definite is [24], which has received
surprisingly little attention. In [24], exponential stability
is proven by relying on a seemingly non-strict dissipativ-
ity assumption. However, whie the standard strict dissi-
pativity assumption is known to yield the same result,
the connection about these two (at first sight) rather
different assumptions has never been investigated be-
fore, to the best of the author’s knowledge. As we wil
prove in this paper, the two assumptions actually imply
each other. Moreover, the connection between them can
be done through the formulation of two infinite-horizon
OCPs, one causal and forward in time, while the other
one anticausal and backward in time. This result fur-
ther highlights the deep connection between dissipativ-
ity and OCPs formulated in forward and backward time,
as discussed in the seminal papers on dissipativity [25–
27] (though the concept of strict dissipativity has been
introduced only much later). Finally, [10] investigates
how exponential stability can be obtained by means of a
suitable terminal cost in finite horizon linear quadratic
EMPC under the requirement that the rotated cost is
positive definite. We will extend those results to the pos-

itive semi-definite case.
The main difficulty when relaxing the requirement on
the cost to be positive definite is that the OCP solution
is not related to the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equa-
tion (DARE). Nevertheless, it can be related to a Con-
strained Generalized DARE (CGDARE), see [28] which
provides an excellent discussion and a very sharp anal-
ysis of the properties of the CGDARE and its solutions,
their relation to the corresponding infinite-horizon op-
timal control problem and to exponential stability. We
will exploit those results and extend them to prove our
results.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2 we state the optimal control problem and the
corresponding Riccati equations. In Section 3 we provide
some preliminray results that will be helpful to prove
our main results which are provided in Section 4 for the
infinite-horizon case and in Section 5 for the finite hori-
zon case. We briefly comment on the case in which some
optimal controls might be stabilizing while others are
not in Secrtion 6 and we conclude the paper in Section 7.

xk+1 = Axk + Buk,
with state x ∈Rnx and control input u ∈Rnu; and

.
Under suitable assumptions on P f, the LQR solution is
characterized by a solution P with associated feedback
matrix K of the Constrained Generalized Discrete Alge-
braic Riccati Equation (CGDARE) [28]
P = Q + A⊤PA −(S⊤+ A⊤PB)K,
(2a)
K = (R + B⊤PB)†(S + B⊤PA),
(2b)
ker(R + B⊤PB) ⊆ker(S⊤+ A⊤PB),
(2c)
where † denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse. Note
that, as discussed in [28], Condition (2c) is necessary in
order for the CGDARE to correctly relate to OCP (1), as
it can be shown to be directly related to the optimality
conditions of OCP (1). Furthermore, we are interested
in symmetric solutions only, and we will simply refer to
symmetric solutions as solutions in the remainder of this
paper.
We define
QP := Q + A⊤PA −P,
SP := S + B⊤PA,
(3a)
RP := R + B⊤PB,
HP :=

(4b)
ker(RP ) ⊆ker(S⊤

(4c)
We will also use the same shorthand notation in order
to define various dissipativity assumptions.
As proven in [28], the CGDARE provides both the op-
timal feedback law
F(x, v) = −Kx + Gv,
v arbitrary,
(5)
where
G = I −R†
P RP ,
defining the closed-loop system
x+ = (A −BK)x + BGv,
v arbitrary,
(6)
and the associated quadratic value function
V (x) = x⊤Px.
Note that, in case RP is invertible, then the CGDARE
coincides with the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation

(7b)
where, since RP is full rank ker(RP ) = 0, and the last

properties of the regularized DARE (rDARE)

as we will prove that, under a quadratic strict pre-
dissipativity assumption, it has the same solutions as
the CGDARE.
If it exists, we will denote as Ps the stabilizing solution to
the CGDARE or rDARE, i.e., having the corresponding
feedback Ks such that the eigenvalues of A−BKs are all
inside the unit circle. Note that we will prove later that,
under some conditions that will turn out to be necessary
for stability the two coincide and need therefore not be
distinguished.
In order to prove our results, we will also exploit the Re-
verse Constrained Generalized Discrete-time Algebraic
Riccati Equation (RCGDARE), defined as:
¯P = ¯Q + ¯A⊤¯P ¯A −( ¯S⊤+ ¯A⊤¯P ¯B) ¯K,
(9a)
¯K = ( ¯R + ¯B⊤¯P ¯B)†( ¯S + ¯B⊤¯P ¯A),
(9b)
ker( ¯R + ¯B⊤¯P ¯B) ⊆ker( ¯S + ¯B⊤¯P ¯A),
(9c)
where
¯A := A−1,
¯B := A−1B,
¯Q := −¯A⊤Q ¯A,
¯S := S ¯A −¯B⊤Q ¯A,
¯R := −R + S ¯B + ¯B⊤S⊤−¯B⊤Q ¯B,
¯H :=
" ¯Q ¯S⊤
¯S ¯R
#
.
If it exists, we define as ¯Ps the stabilizing solution
of the RCGDARE (and the corresponing rRDARE).
Note that, if R −SA−1B is nonsingular, this solution
coincides with the antistabilizing solution of the CG-
DARE/rDARE [29]. This establishes a strong similarity
with the continuous-time case, where the antistabilizing
solution is the stabilizing solution of the same problem
formulated in reverse time.
Remark 2.1 Note that, though throughout the paper we
assume that (A, B) is stabilizable, we will first restrict our
attention to the study of its controllable subpart. In that
case, we will exploit the fact that for any controllable sys-
tem, one can introduce some suitably designed feedback
matrix F which makes A −BF full rank. Consequently,
as discussed in, e.g., [10, Theorem 3.8, Remark 3.9], the
existence of A−1 can be assumed without loss of gener-
ality in the controllable case. After deriving the results
for the controllable case, we will generalize them to the
stabilizable case.

Preliminary Results
Before proving our main results, we state the following
useful properties of the CGDARE.
We define Z as the null space matrix of RP , i.e.
RP Z = 0,
Z⊤Z = I.
(10)
Lemma 3.1 Matrix G satisfies
G = ZZ⊤,
where Z is defined as per (10).
PROOF. We observe that a singular value decomposi-
tion on the symmetric matrices RP and R†
P yields
G = I −R†
P RP
= I −V Σ†V ⊤V ΣV ⊤
= V V ⊤−V Σ†ΣV ⊤.
(11)
Note that V =
h
Y Z
i
is orthonormal, where Y and Z
are, respectively, range and null space matrices of RP
and, consequently, also of R†
P . Moreover,
Σ†Σ =
"
I 0
0 0
#
,
I −Σ†Σ =
"
0 0
0 I
#
.
Consequently, we have that (11) reads
G = ZZ⊤,
where, in case RP is full rank, Σ†Σ = I, Z is empty, and
G = 0.
2
We recall that, for P1, P2 solutions of the CGDARE [28,
Theorem 4.3] states that ker RP1 = ker RP2. Conse-
quently, matrix G is independent of which P solving the
CGDARE is used to define it.
Lemma 3.2 For any P solving the CGDARE it holds
that
(RP + G)−1 = R†
P + G,
(RP + G)−1SP = R†
P SP .
Consequently, any solution P with corresponding feed-
back K of the CGDARE is a solution of the rDARE,
though the converse might not be true.

Moreover, since S⊤
P G = 0, we have that GSP = 0, which
proves that P, K are a solution of the rDARE.
Finally, we observe that, for all P solving the CGDARE
one can simplify the rDARE as
0 = QP −S⊤
P K,
K = (RP + G)−1SP
= R†
P SP .
However, the rDARE can have additional solutions Pdare
which do not satisfy
RPdareG = 0,
S⊤
PdareG = 0,
which can not be solutions of the CGDARE.
2
In order to further clarify the result of Lemma 3.2, and its
implications on the connection between solutions of the
CGDARE and the rDARE, let us introduce the following
example.
Example 3.3 Consider a system with matrices
A =

B =

with stage cost matrices
Q =

R = 0,
S = 0.
The CGDARE has solution
P =

#
.
The rDARE has a stabilizing solution
Ps = I,
Ks =
"
0.75 0.5
−0.25 0.5
#
.
One can verify that P solves the rDARE, though it is
not the stabilizing solution. Finally, one can also check
that Ps does not solve the CGDARE. Nore that for this
example we have
BG =
"
1 −1
0
0
#
,
i.e., the closed-loop behavior is not unique, as different
optimal control inputs yield different state trajectories.
This example motivates a deeper study of the case
BG = 0. We will prove in Section 4 that, under a
quadratic strict pre-dissipativity assumption we can
guarantee that BG = 0. In the next lemma, we prove
that BG = 0 entails that the solutions of the CGDARE
coincide with the solutions of the rDARE. We will
prove in Section 4 that quadratic strict pre-dissipativity
guarantees, among other properties, that BG = 0.
Lemma 3.4 Assume that BG = 0 and RP ⪰0. Then
any P solving the CGDARE is a solution of the rDARE
and viceversa.
PROOF. We observe that BG = 0 entails RG = 0 and
S⊤G = 0, such that for all Λ it holds that
RΛG = 0,
S⊤
Λ G = 0.
Consequently, for any Λ such that RΛ ⪰0 we have
(RΛ + G)−1 = R†
Λ + G,
(RΛ + G)−1SΛ = R†
ΛSΛ.
(12)
Because RP ⪰0 for all P solving the CGDARE, then
Lemma 3.2 entails that RP +G ≻0 solves the rDARE for
all P solving the CGDARE. Consequently, RP + G ≻0
for all P solving the CGDARE as they also solve the
rDARE, then RP + G ≻0 for all P solving the rDARE.
In turn, this entails that RP ⪰0 for all P solving the
rDARE. Consequently, (12) holds for all P solving the
rDARE, which entails that all P solving the rDARE also
solve the CGDARE.
2
Lemma 3.5 If any P solving the CGDARE with H ⪰0
is full rank, then BG = 0.
4


PROOF. By [28, Theorem 4.3], G is independent of
which symmetric P solving the CGDARE is used to de-
fine it. Moreover, by [28, Lemmas 4.1, 4.2], in case H ⪰0
ker RP = ker
"
PB
R
#
,
for any P solving the CGDARE. Because we assume that
P is full rank, we further have
ker RP = ker
"
PB
R
#
= ker
"
B
R
#
.
(13)
Lemma 3.1 yields G = ZZ⊤. Moreover, by (13), Z is a
null space matrix for B and BG = BZZ⊤= 0.
2
Because it is easier to study the properties of OCP (1)
and the corresponding CGDARE in case H ⪰0, we will
exploit so-called cost rotations to reconduct the generic
case to the case H ⪰0. For a given matrix Λ, these
cost rotations consist in replacing the stage and terminal
cost matrices H and P f with HΛ defined as per (3) and
P f
Λ := P f −Λ.
Remark 3.6 In the literature on economic MPC, cost
rotations for a given matrix Λ are usually defined as H−Λ
and P f
Λ := P f + Λ. Since that is just a convention and
because in the context of this paper it is notationally and
conceptually simpler to use HΛ and P f
Λ := P f −Λ, we
will stick to this last convention.
We will prove in Section 4 that assuming the existence of
matrix Λ such that HΛ ⪰0 is not restrictive. We provide
next some useful properties related to cost rotations.
We define the rotated linear-quadratic OCP as
VΛ(ˆx0) = min
x,u

N→∞
N−1

k=0

(14a)
s.t. x0 = ˆx0,
(14b)
xk+1 = Axk + Buk,
(14c)
which only differs from the original OCP (1) in that H
and P f are replaced by HΛ and P f
Λ = P f −Λ.
Lemma 3.7 The costs of the rotated OCP (14) and the
original OCP (1) only differ by the constant term x⊤
0 Λx0
and the cost-to-go matrix of the rotated OCP satisfies
PΛ = P −Λ. Moreover, any state-input trajectory that
is optimal for the rotated OCP is also optimal for the
original OCP and viceversa.
PROOF. The first claim is proven in, e.g., [5,10] or
[24, Lemma 2.2], where it is observed that for feasible
trajectories the costs only differ by the constant term
ˆx⊤
0 Λˆx0. The second claim directly follows from the first
one.
2
We recalled before that G is independent of which CG-
DARE solution P is used to define it. We prove next
that it is also independent of cost rotations.
Lemma 3.8 Matrix G is independent of cost rotations.
PROOF. We exploit the fact that PΛ = P −Λ to write
RΛ + B⊤PΛB = R + B⊤ΛB + B⊤(P −Λ)B
= R + B⊤PB.
Consequently, G is independent of cost rotations.
2
We prove next a technical result related to the RCG-
DARE which will be useful later on.
Lemma 3.9 Suppose that BG = 0 and A−1 exists, such
that the RCGDARE is well defined. Then, ¯G = G.
PROOF. Because BG = 0 we have
RG = 0,
S⊤G = 0.
Consequently, we immediately obtain
¯BG = 0,
¯RG = 0,
¯S⊤G = 0,
(15)
such that
ker

Additionally, because A−1 is full rank, we can write

with Ψ full row rank, such that

which entails ker ¯R ¯

Finally, as it will be helpful to state our results in the
more general context of nonlinear systems with generic
stage costs, we recall next the common assumption used
in the generic setting. For a given stage cost ℓ(x, u) and
system dynamics x+ = f(x, u), strict dissipativity with
respect to steady state xs, us is defined as follows.
Definition 3.10 (Strict Dissipativity) There exists
a function λ such that
L(x, u) := ℓ(x, u) −ℓ(xs, us) + λ(x) −λ(f(x, u))
≥ρ(∥x −xs∥),
(16)
for all x, u ∈Z ⊂Rnx+nu, with Z compact and ρ a
positive definite function.
Note that L is referred to as rotated cost and ρ is pos-
itive definite with respect to x, but not u, such that in
the linear-quadratic case we call such a function posi-
tive semi-definite. The weaker dissipativity assumption
is obtained if (16) holds with ρ(·) = 0. It has been proven
in [5] that strict dissipativity is sufficient for asymptotic
stability, while necessity has been proven in [6] under a
local controllability assumption.

Main Results
In this section, we first connect the existence of a solu-
tion to the CGDARE with dissipativity concepts. Sub-
sequently, we connect the existence of a stabilizing solu-
tion to the CGDARE with strict dissipativity concepts.
While the first part is mostly known, we find it useful to
present the existing results with a point of view which
better connects them with the second part of the paper
and further clarifies the relationship with concepts com-
monly used in the literature about EMPC. The second
part recalls some existing results, connects them with
existing results stated for the general nonlinear case and
further explains the deep connection of strict dissipativ-
ity and Riccati equations.
4.1
Existence of the Solution
In order to discuss the existence of a solution to the
CGDARE and its correspondence with the solution of
the OCP (1), we introduce the following dissipativity
assumption.
Assumption 4.1 (Quadratic Pre-Dissipativity)
There exists a matrix Λ such that
HΛ ⪰0.
While in the next theorem we assume stabilizability, that
could be relaxed by assuming that the uncontrollable
unstable modes yield zero cost. However, as the focus of
our analysis is proving exponential stability, our stronger
assumption is not restrictive in the context of this paper.
Theorem 4.2 Suppose that Assumption 4.1 holds and
(A, B) is stabilizable. Then the CGDARE formulated
with the rotated stage cost matrix HΛ ⪰0 has a solu-
tion PΛ ⪰0, which is also the cost-to-go of the infinite-
horizon rotated OCP with terminal cost P f
Λ = 0 whose
optimal feedback law is given by
u = −Kx + Gv,
v arbitrary.
The solution of the problem formulated using the original
cost yields the same state and control input trajecotires
as the one of the rotated problem. The cost-to-go matrix
of the original OCP satisfies
P = PΛ + Λ.
PROOF. The result is a consequence of [28, Theo-
rem 2.1]. The key observation is that the rotated prob-
lem (14) and the original problem (1) deliver the same
feedback law and a shifted cost-to-go matrix PΛ = P −Λ.
Then, as proven in [30,28], P f
Λ = 0 guarantees that the
optimal solution is obtained from the generalized Ric-
cati difference equation (i.e., by value iteration).
One can then apply [28, Theorem 2.1] to the rotated cost,
since stabilizability of (A, B) entails the existence of an
infinite sequence of inputs yielding a finite rotated cost.
The optimal state and input trajectories of the original
and rotated OCP coincide as proven in Lemma 3.7. Fi-
nally, one can write the rotated CGDARE as
0 = QPΛ+Λ −S⊤
PΛ+ΛK,
K = R†
PΛ+ΛSPΛ+Λ,
ker(RPΛ+Λ) ⊆ker(S⊤
PΛ+Λ).
By replacing P = PΛ + Λ one immediately recovers the
original CGDARE.
2
Note that the (in general non-unique) solutions of the
CGDARE are independent of the terminal cost, whose
proper choice is a necessary condition for the positive
semi-definite solution to be the optimal cost, but not
for its existence. Additionally, if the terminal cost ma-
trix P f is selected as any solution of the CGDARE, then
the optimal cost-to-go matrix matches that specific so-
lution of the CGDARE. A detailed analysis of the role
of the terminal cost can be found in [10] for the case
in which quadratic strict (x, u) pre-dissipativity holds,
i.e., if there exists Λ such that HΛ ≻0. The extension
6


of the results of [10] to the weaker quadratic strict pre-
dissipativity Assumption 4.5-4.7 will be discussed in Sec-
tion 5.
Before moving forward with our analysis, we would like
to discuss the necessity of Assumption 4.1. To that end,
we recall that, as discussed in [31], if any solution P of the
CGDARE satisfies RP ⪰0, then all solutions satisfy the
same inequality. Note that Theorem 4.2 establishes that
both RΛ ⪰0 and PΛ ⪰0, such that also RP = RPΛ ⪰0.
Theorem 4.3 Assume that the CGDARE has a sym-
metric solution P satisfying RP ⪰0. Then Assump-
tion 4.1 holds.
PROOF. Since by assumption RP
⪰0, then [28,
Lemma 2.1]
HP ⪰0
⇔
QP −S⊤
P R†
P SP ⪰0.
However, since P solves the CGDARE, we have
QP −S⊤
P R†
P SP = 0,
such that Assumption 4.1 holds with Λ = P.
2
We observe that the condition RP ⪰0 is necessary
for the optimal control input yielded by (1) to remain
bounded, as also discussed in [31]. This proves the ne-
cessity of quadratic pre-dissipativity for the OCP (1) to
have bounded solutions ∥u(x)∥< ∞for all ∥x∥< ∞,
∥v∥< ∞.
4.2
Exponential Stability for Controllable (A, B)
In this section, we discuss the stability properties of the
closed-loop system (6). To that end we define stability
as follows.
Definition 4.4 (Stability) Given a system x+ = Ax,
the origin is
(i) stable if for every ϵ > 0 there exists δ(ϵ) > 0 such
that ∥Akx∥< ϵ for all k and all ∥x∥< δ(ϵ);
(ii) (globally) asymptotically stable if it is stable and
limk→∞Akx = 0
We observe that [32, Theorem 10.9]:
(i) stability ⇔all eigenvalues of A are within or on the
unit circle of the complex plane, and every eigen-
value that is on the unit circle has an associated
Jordan blockof order 1;
(ii) asymptotic stability ⇔all eigenvalues of A are
within the unit circle, i.e., matrix A is Schur stable.
Consequently, asymptotic stability is a global property
and is equivalent to exponential stability.
Conditions guaranteeing exponential stability of the
closed-loop system (6) have been established in [24],
and rely on the following assumption.
Assumption 4.5 There exist matrices Λ1, Λ2 such that
HΛ1 ⪰0,
HΛ2 ⪰0,
rank(Λ1 −Λ2) = nx.
We will prove next that the following seemingly stronger
assumptions are actually equivalent to Assumption 4.5.
Assumption 4.6 There exist matrices Λ1, Λ2 such that
HΛ1 ⪰0,
HΛ2 ⪰0,
Λ1 −Λ2 ≻0.
Assumption 4.7 (Quadratic Strict Pre-Dissipativity)
There exist matrix Λ such that
RΛ ⪰0,
QΛ −S⊤
Λ R†
ΛSΛ ≻0.
Before providing our results,we ought to observe that
Assumption 4.7 is the linear-quadratic equivalent of the
standard strict pre-dissipativity assumption for the non-
linear case, i.e., Definition 3.10 where Z need not be com-
pact [33]. As we will prove that Assumptions 4.5, 4.6, 4.7
are equivalent, we will refer to all of them as quadratic
strict pre-dissipativity whenever the distinction is not
relevant. Finally, let us clarify that checking Assump-
tions 4.5 or 4.7 is nontrivial, while Assumption 4.6 can
be checked by solving a suitably formulated SDP. We
will discuss this aspect in Section 4.4.
In [24] it is claimed that Assumption 4.5 is sufficient and
necessary for exponential stability. We prove next that
the same is true for Assumptions 4.6 and 4.7.
Theorem 4.8 Suppose that (A, B) is controllable and
either Assumption 4.6 or Assumption 4.7 holds. Then,
the closed-loop system (6) is exponentially stable and
BG = 0. Moreover, both Assumption 4.6 and 4.7 are
necessary for exponential stability, hence they imply each
other.
PROOF. We consider first the case in which Assump-
tion 4.7 holds for some matrix Λ2. This immediately en-
tails that a full-rank solution PΛ2 ≻0 exists, such that,
7


by Lemma 3.5 we have BG = 0. One can prove that
PΛ2 ≻0 by observing that, starting with zero terminal
cost, the first step of the Riccati iterations (i.e., value it-
eration) yields cost-to-go PΛ2,1 = QΛ2−S⊤
Λ2R†
Λ2SΛ2 ≻0,
such that for all n > 1 we have PΛ2 ⪰Pn ⪰P1 ≻0 [10,
Lemma 3.17]. Consequently, we can alternatively rotate
the cost using Λ1 = Λ2 +PΛ2 ≻Λ2, and Assumption 4.7
entails Assumption 4.6.
We prove next that Assumption 4.6 is yields exponential
stability. We define Λ1,2 = Λ1 −Λ2 ≻0, such that
HΛ1 = HΛ2+Λ1,2,
By Theorem 4.2 HΛ2 ⪰0 entails the existence of a solu-
tion PΛ2 ⪰0 and, in turn of a solution
PΛ1 = PΛ2 + Λ1,2 ≻0,
which, by Lemma 3.5 entails BG = 0. Moreover, by
defining ¯K = R†
PΛ1SPΛ1, we have
(A −B ¯K)⊤PΛ1(A −B ¯K) −PΛ1
= QΛ1 −¯K⊤SΛ1 −S⊤
Λ1 ¯K + ¯K⊤RΛ1 ¯K ⪯0.
This entails that A−B ¯K has all eigenvalues inside or on
the unit circle, possibly except for some of them on the
unit circle (corresponding to 1 by 1 Jordan blocks) [32,
Theorem 10.11].
Because the system is controllable, an exponentially sta-
bilizing solution to OCP (1) formulated with the addi-
tional constraint limk→∞xk = 0 exists and yields a lin-
ear feedback Ks with quadratic cost-to-go matrix Ps.
In order to prove necessity, consider the case in which
one of the solutions Ps, Ks of the CGDARE yields expo-
nential stability, such that BG = 0. Then, for any ˜Q ≻0
there exists a matrix V ≻0 satisfying
(A −BKs)⊤V (A −BKs) −V = −˜Q ≺0.
Let us select Λ = Ps −V such that PΛ,s = V ≻0, and
HΛ ⪰0 if and only if
RΛ ⪰0,
QΛ −S⊤
Λ R†
ΛSΛ ⪰0.
We observe that the first condition holds for ˜Q small
enough, while the second one can be transformed as fol-
lows. We first rewrite the rotated CGDARE as
(A −BKs)⊤PΛ,s(A −BKs) −PΛ,s
= −(QΛ −K⊤
s SΛ −S⊤
Λ Ks + K⊤
s RΛKs) = −˜Q,
such that we can write
QΛ −S⊤
Λ R†
ΛSΛ
= ˜Q −S⊤
Λ R†
ΛSΛ + S⊤
Λ Ks + K⊤
s SΛ −K⊤
s RΛKs
= ˜Q −(S⊤
Λ −K⊤
s RΛ)R†
Λ(SΛ −RΛKs).
We observe next that
SΛ −RΛKs = SPs −RPsKs + B⊤V (A −BKs),
= B⊤V (A −BKs).
Consequently,
˜Q −(S⊤
Λ −K⊤
s RΛ)R†
Λ(SΛ −RΛKs)
= ˜Q −(A −BKs)⊤V BR†
ΛB⊤V (A −BKs).
Therefore, HΛ ⪰0 if and only if
RΛ ⪰0,
˜Q ⪰(A −BKs)⊤˜V (A −BKs),
(17)
where ˜V := V BR†
ΛB⊤V . We prove next that Condi-
tion (17) can be satisfied for a sufficiently small ˜Q. As-
sume that the condition does not hold for some ˆQ ≻0
yielding Lyapunov matrix ˆV , and select ˜Q = a ˆQ with
a > 0. Note that for a ≤1 we have 0 ⪯RΛ = RPs−V =
RPs−a ˆV ⪰RPs−ˆV , such that R†
Λ ⪯R†
Ps−ˆV , we obtain
˜V ⪯V BR†
Ps−ˆV B⊤ˆV = a2 ˆV BR†
Ps−ˆV B⊤ˆV ,
such that ˜V is upper bounded by a quantity that scales
quadratically with a, while ˜Q scales linearly. Hence, for
a sufficiently small Condition (17) holds. Moreover, also
RΛ ⪰0 holds for a sufficiently small. This also proves
that in (17) the second inequality can be enforced in
a strict sense, therefore proving necessity of Assump-
tion 4.7 for exponential stability.
So far, we have proven that Assumption 4.7 holds. As
we proved that Assumption 4.7 implies Assumption 4.6
we could stop here. However, we would like to provide
an additional brief and insightful proof that does not
rely on a strict inequality in (17). Following the proof
of [10, Lemma 3.12] we have that dissipativity for the
(rotated) CGDARE also entails dissipativity for the (ro-
tated) RCGDARE, such that there exists a solution
¯PΛ ⪯0. Consequently, one can simply choose Λ1 = Λ +
PΛ,s and Λ2 = Λ+ ¯PΛ, such that Λ1−Λ2 = PΛ,s−¯PΛ ≻0.

The result of Theorem 4.8 entails that the closed-loop
system is asymptotically stable for all optimal control
8


inputs. However, there are also cases in which some op-
timal control inputs stabilize the system, while others
do not, as exemplified by the following example. While
an in-depth analysis of such cases is beyond the scope
of this paper, we will provide a brief discussion on the
subject in Section 6.
Example 4.9 Consider the following system:
A =
"
0.9 1
0
1
#
,
B =
"
2 0
1 1
#
,
Q =

0 0
0 1
#
,
R = 0,
S = 0.
The solution of the DARE is
P =

0 0
0 1
#
,
K =
"
0 0.5
0 0.5
#
,
G =

0.5 −0.5
−0.5
0.5
#
,
such that
A −BK =
"
0.9 0
0
0
#
,
has all eigenvalues strictly inside the unit circle, but some
optimal solutions can destabilize the system, e.g., for
feedback matrix L = −I, yielding v = −Lx we have
A −BK −BGL =
"
1.9 −1
0
0
#
,
which has one eigenvalue outside the unit circle.
Note
that,
while
Assumption
4.1
holds,
Assump-
tions 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 do not hold. Indeed, as stated by The-
orems 4.2 and 4.8, a positive semi-definite solution P
yielding the optimal cost-to-go exists, but the closed-loop
system is not exponentially stable for all optimal control
inputs.
Note that, if
A =
"
1 1
0 1
#
,
similar considerations follow, but v = 0 does not yield
exponential stability, even though there exist infinitely
many matrices L such that v = −Lx does yield exponen-
tial stability. See [28, Example5.1 ] for more details.
This example shows that, whenever BG ̸= 0, there exist
optimal control inputs that destabilize the system, while
other optimal control inputs might stabilize the system.
Indeed, if BG ̸= 0 Assumptions 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 cannot
hold, as they would imply BG = 0.
4.3
Exponential Stability for Stabilizable (A, B)
The results above focused on the case in which (A, B) is
controllable. We provide next the extension to the case
in which (A, B) is stabilizable.
Theorem 4.10 Suppose that (A, B) is stabilizable.
Then, Assumptions 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 all imply each
other. Hence, if any of them holds, the closed-loop sys-
tem (6) is exponentially stable and BG = 0. Moreover,
Assumptions 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 are also necessary for
exponential stability.
PROOF. Let us assume without loss of generality that
the system is in the form of the Kalman controllability
decomposition
A =
"
A11
0
A21 A22
#
,
B =

(18)
with (A22, B2) controllable, and A11 asymptotically sta-
ble. Then we have
B⊤PB = B⊤
2 P22B2;
B⊤PA =
h
s1(P12, P22) s2(P22)
i

with
s1(P12, P22) := B⊤
2 P12A11 + B⊤
2 P22A21,
s2(P22) := B⊤
2 P22A22;
and
A⊤PA =

q12(P12, P22)⊤

q12(P12, P22) := A⊤

q22(P22) := A⊤

Consequently,

S2 + s2(P22)

#
.
This entails that the lower right block Hc
P22 only depends
on P22, i.e., the controllable subsystem is independent
of the rest. We can then apply Theorem 4.8 to the con-
trollable subsystem.
We prove next that, if quadratic strict pre-dissipativity
holds for the controllable subsystem, then it also holds
for the full system, since all uncontrollable modes are
exponentially stable. Note that, by Theorem 4.8 and [24]
the three quadratic strict pre-dissipativity assumptions
are equivalent for controllable systems, hence we do not
need to distinguish among them.
By Lemma 3.5 quadratic strict pre-dissipativity entails
B2G = 0 and, consequently, BG = 0. Hence,
Hc,G
P22 := Hc
P22 +
"
0 0

#
≻0.
Moreover, stabilizability entails that A11 has all eigen-
values inside the unit circle. Hence, for fixed matrices
P12, P22, the quantity A⊤
11P11A11 −P11 can be made ar-
bitrarily large by a suitable choice of P11. Consequently,
if we rewrite the blocks of HP such that
HP =
"
ΩΣ⊤
Σ Θ
#
,
where Θ := R + B⊤
2 P22B2 ⪰0, we have that
Ω−Σ⊤Θ†Σ = Ω−Σ⊤(Θ + G)†Σ
= Ω−Σ⊤(Θ + G)−1Σ ≻0,
i.e., Assumption 4.7 holds.
The proof of Theorem 4.8 then directly entails that also
Assumption 4.6 and, in turn, Assumption 4.5 hold for
the controllable subsystem. Additionally, if both Ps and
¯Ps exist for the controllable subsystem, they must also
exist for the full system, as the uncontrollable modes are
exponentially stable. Consequently, Assumption 4.6 and
Assumption 4.5 must hold for the full system. Exploiting
the fact that the solutions of the CGDARE and of the
rDARE coincide, we then obtain that HG
Λ ≻0, such
that, by taking the Schur complement we conclude that
also Assumption 4.7 must hold.
2
Remark 4.11 Note that, because Lemma 3.4 states that
if BG = 0 the solutions of the CGDARE are solutions
of the rDARE and viceversa, the CGDARE inherits also
all well-known properties of DAREs, i.e., if it exists, the
stabilizing solution is unique, and all solutions P satisfy
Ps ⪰P, if Ps exists; P ⪰¯Ps, if ¯Ps exists; Ps ≻¯Ps if both
exist.
4.4
Checking Quadratic Strict Pre-Dissipativity
While the theory we developed proved that the quadratic
strict pre-dissipativity assumptions we considered are
equivalent, in practice they are not equally easy to check.
A procedure to check Assumption 4.5 in several steps is
given in [24]. Assumption 4.7 is not easy to check as the
second inequality is nonlinear. Assumption 4.6, instead,
can be checked by solving one suitably formulated SDP.
One option consists in solving
min
Λ1,Λ2,a −a
(19a)
s.t. HΛ1 ⪰0,
(19b)
HΛ2 ⪰0,
(19c)
Λ1 −Λ2 ⪰aI,
(19d)
and checking if a > 0.
We provide next an alternative formulation, which we
consider insightful for the case in which (A, B) is con-
trollable. As an alternative to (19), one can solve
min
Λ1,Λ2 −tr(Λ1 −Λ2)
(20a)
s.t. HΛ1 ⪰0,
(20b)
HΛ2 ⪰0.
(20c)
and check whether Λ1 ≻Λ2.
For controllable systems SDP (20) allows us to further
discuss the tight relation between quadratic strict pre-
dissipativity, especially in the form of Assumption 4.6,
and the stabilizing solutions of the CGDARE and
RCGDARE. In fact, as we prove in the next lemma,
if quadratic strict pre-dissipativity holds and (A, B) is
controllable, its solution is Λ1 = Ps, Λ2 = ¯Ps.
Lemma 4.12 Assume that (A, B) is controllable. Then,
any Λ such that HΛ ⪰0 satisfies Ps ⪰Λ if Ps exists; and
Λ ⪰¯Ps if ¯Ps exists.
PROOF. We first prove that Λ ⪰Ps cannot satisfy
dissipativity. Using the same argument we will obtain
10


that that Λ ⪯¯Ps cannot satisfy dissipativity. Finally, we
will use those results to complete the proof.
Let us consider the interpretation of the CGDARE as
the solution of OCP (1) over horizon one, with terminal
cost P0 = Ps. Let us add a matrix E ̸= 0, E ⪰0 to the
terminal cost. First, we observe that RPs+E ⪰RPs ⪰0.
Moreover, we obtain cost-to-go matrix P1 ̸= Ps, P1 ⪰Ps.
The one-step Riccati recursion reads
Q + A⊤(Ps + E)A −P1 −S⊤
Ps+ER†
Ps+ESPs+E = 0.
(21)
Moreover, since Ps is the maximal solution of the DARE,
P1 ̸= Ps + E, such that
QPs+E −S⊤
Ps+ER†
Ps+ESPs+E ̸= 0.
We observe that by [10, Theorem 4.7] the Riccati recur-
sion with terminal cost matrix P0 = Ps + E converges,
such that by [10, Lemma 3.17] we must have
P1 ⪰̸ P0 = Ps + E,
which, using (21), entails
QPs+E −S⊤
Ps+ER†
Ps+ESPs+E ⪰̸ 0,
and, in turn HPs+E ⪰̸ 0. The exact same argument can
be used to prove that H ¯
Ps−E ⪰̸ 0.
This proves that both Λ ⪰Ps and Λ ⪯¯Ps cannot satisfy
dissipativity. Consider now the case in which Λ ⪰̸ Ps,
Λ ⪯̸ Ps, and split Λ as
Λ = Λ+ + Λ−+ Ps,
Λ+ ⪰0,
Λ−⪯0.
Rotate the cost a first time using Λ−+Ps. Then, rotating
a second time using Λ+ ⪰0 falls under the case we
proved above, which proves the claims.
2
In the lemma above, we assumed controllability, because
if the uncontrollable modes in A are stable, then the
uncontrollable modes in ¯A are unstable. Consequently,
¯Ps does not exist. In case the system is not controllable,
assuming without loss of generality that the system is in
the Kalman controllability decomposition (18), one can
partition matrix E consistently as
E =
"
E11 E12
E21 E22
#
,
where E11 and E12 = E⊤
21 can be chosen arbitrarily,
while E22 ⪯0.
For E12 = E⊤
21 = 0, E22 = 0 this yields
S⊤
Ps+ER†
Ps+ESPs+E = S⊤
PsR†
PsSPs.
Additionally, E11 can be chosen such that
A⊤
11E11A11 −E11≺0.
Consequently, any matrix satisfying the inequality above
can be multiplied by an arbitrarily large constant while
still satisfying the inequality. Hence, the SDP solution
is unbounded. Clearly, infinitely many others are also
possible. Consequently, if (A, B) is stabilizable but not
controllable, SDP (20) is unbounded. A simple fix can
then be to introduce a constraint of the form
Λ1 −Λ2 ⪯bI,
for some fixed and sufficiently large constant b. Alter-
natively, one could add the term b(tr(Λ1 −Λ2))2 to the
cost for some fixed constant b.
5
Finite Horizon and Terminal Cost
In this section, we consider the finite-horizon case and
we discuss the role of the terminal cost in providing ex-
ponential stability. To that end, we exploit the theory
developed so far to extend the results of [10] to the case
in which quadratic strict (x, u) pre-dissipativity does not
hold, but quadratic strict pre-dissipativity does hold.
The main question is how exponential stability can be
enforced in finite-horizon EMPC by means of suitable
terminal costs, without terminal constraints.
We introduce the Receding-Horizon OCP(RHOCP)
V (ˆx0) = min
x,u
N−1
X
k=0

(22b)
xk+1 = Axk + Buk,
(22c)
which delivers the optimal feedback law
FN(x, v) = −KNx + GNv,
v arbitrary,
(23)
with PN, KN defined by the generalized Riccati recur-
sion
Pn+1 = Q + A⊤PnA −(S⊤+ A⊤PnB)Kn+1,
(24a)
Kn+1 = (R + B⊤PnB)†(S + B⊤PnA),
(24b)
where P0 = P f, and
GN := I −R†
PN RPN .
11


The corresponding the closed-loop system is
x+ = (A −BKN)x + BGNv,
v arbitrary.
(25)
In order to obtain the desired results, we will exploit
the fact that, if quadratic strict pre-dissipativity holds,
then the properties of the CGDARE can be studied by
exploiting the rDARE instead. Moreover, if BG = 0,
then (see Lemma 3.4)
RΛG = 0,
S⊤
Λ G = 0,
holds for all Λ, and not just for those solving the CG-
DARE. This will be particularly helpful for the finite
horizon case, as the finite-horizon solution does in gen-
eral not match the infinite-time solution. Additionally,
also the RCGDARE can be studied by exploiting the
corresponding rRDARE, as we prove in the next lemma.
Theorem 5.1 (Extension of [10, Theorem 4.7])
Consider a strictly pre-dissipative OCP (1) with control-
lable (A, B) and let ¯Ps be the stabilizing solution of the
RCGDARE. Choose the terminal cost matrix Pf ≻¯Ps.
Then the optimal solution is given by the unique stabiliz-
ing solution of the corresponding DARE. In particular,
the origin is an asymptotically stable equilibrium of the
optimally controlled system.
PROOF. The key observation is given in Lemma 3.4,
which states that, as quadratic strict pre-dissipativity
entails BG = 0 and RP ⪰0 for all P colving the
CGDARE, then the solutions of the CGDARE and
the rDARE coincide. Consequently, we can directly
apply [10, Theorem 4.7].
2
Theorem 5.2 (Extension of [10, Theorem 4.9])
Consider a controllable pair (A, B) equipped with a
strictly pre-dissipative stage cost and let ¯Ps be the sta-
bilizingsolution of the corresponding RCGDARE. Select
the terminal cost matrix as P f ≻¯Ps. Then, for any suf-
ficiently large finite horizon N the RHOCP (22) yields
a closed-loop system (25) for which the origin is globally
exponentially stable.
PROOF. Also in this case, we invoke Lemma 3.4, in
particular the fact that (12) holds for any Λ, i.e., GN =
G, and the equivalence between the original formulation
and the one with regularization u⊤Gu holds not only
for the infinite horizon problem (i.e., the CGDARE and
rDARE share the same solutions), but also throughout
the generalized Riccati iterations (i.e., the value itera-
tion). This allows us to apply [10, Theorem 4.9] to the
regularized problem and carry over the result to the orig-
inal problem.
2
The extension of the results above to the stabilizable case
is directly obtained by applying the arguments used in
the proof of Theorem 4.10 and further noticing that the
choice of bounded P f
11, P f
12 can be made arbitrarily, as it
does not affect KN and only shifts the non-controllable
blocks of PN.
6
The Stabilizable but Possibly Unstable Case
In this section, we briefly discuss the case in which
the CGDARE does have a solution P
satisfying
R + B⊤PB ⪰0, but does not yield an exponentially
stable optimal closed-loop system (6). Note that this
case is discussed in [28] and in Example 4.9, which is
taken from [28].
Note that, if BG = 0, by Lemma 3.4 all P, K solutions
to the CGDARE are also solutions of the rDARE and
viceversa. Hence, quadratic strict (x, u) pre-dissipativity
cannot hold for the rDARE and, in turn, quadratic strict
pre-dissipativity cannot hold for the CGDARE. When
instead, BG ̸= 0, the optimal closed-loop system (6)
does not define a single state trajectory, and the cost
might allow both stabilizing and destabilizing optimal
solutions. In case some of the optimal solutions are stabi-
lizing, one might be interested in selecting one of those.
Unfortunately, straightforward attempts at generalizing
quadratic strict pre-dissipativity yield inequalities of the
form
HΛ +
"
L⊤TL TL
L⊤T
T
#
⪰0,
"
PB
R
#
T = 0.
Note that the first condition is a nonlinear matrix in-
equality and the second condition is not easy to satisfy
without solving the CGRDARE first. However, if one
does solve the CGDARE, one can pick T = G, but the
first condition still remains nonlinear in L. The idea to
remove nonlinearities by regularizing the control input
only, i.e., by selecting L = 0, cannot work if some uncon-
trollable and unstable mode has zero cost. Such a situ-
ation occurs, e.g., in the second case in Example 4.9, as
we explain next.
Example 6.1 Consider once more the second system in
Example 4.9, i.e.:
A =
"
1 1
0 1
#
,
B =
"
2 0
1 1
#
,
Q =
"
0 0
0 1
#
,
R = 0,
S = 0.
12


Any cost rotation yields
Q + A⊤ΛA =
"
0
Λ11
Λ11 Λ11 + 2Λ12
#
⊁0.
Consequently, there exists no cost rotation that can sat-
isfy Assumption 4.7.
However, if the system is pre-stabilized first, e.g., using
feedback ˆK = 0.5I, A −B ˆK has all eigenvalues inside
the unit circle, and in this specific case the cost matrices
remain unchanged [10], since S = 0, R = 0. The solution
of the DARE is
P =
"
0 0
0 1
#
,
K =
"
−0.25 0.25
−0.25 0.25
#
,
G =
"
0.5 −0.5
−0.5
0.5
#
.
As expected, P is unchanged, while K does change. In
this case, regularizing the rotated cost as
HG
Λ := HΛ +
"
0 0
0 G
#
,
makes it possible to find a matrix Λ such that HG
Λ ≻0.
The example above suggests a possible, though a bit
cumbersome, procedure to takle the case in which some
optimal controls might be stabilizing while others might
not be. In particular, one can: (i) pre-stabilize the system
using the desired technique to compute feedback matrix
ˆK and update the cost matrices as
ˆH =
" ˆQ ˆS⊤
ˆS R
#
,
ˆQ := Q −S⊤ˆK −ˆK⊤S + ˆK⊤R ˆK,
ˆS := S −R ˆK;
(ii) compute any solution of the CGDARE to obtain G;
(iii) define the cost of the corresponding rDARE and
verify if quadratic strict (x, u) dissipativity holds, i.e., if
there exists some matrix Λ such that ˆHΛ ≻0. In case
of a positive answer, then at least one of the optimal
control inputs yields an exponentially stable closed-loop
system. We ought to stress that the obtained solution is
an arbitrary choice among the infinitely many optimal
solutions, which depends on the initial pre-stabilization
in a way which is possibly difficult to predict.

Conclusions
In this paper, we studied economic linear quadratic op-
timal control in case the optimal solution is not unique.
We connected existing stability results for the linear
and nonlinear case and we discussed how the quadratic
strict pre-dissipativity assumption can be interpreted in
terms of solutions to two optimal control problems for-
mulated in forward and backward time. Furthermore, we
provided an assumption with a corresponding compu-
tationally viable procedure to verify if quadratic strict
pre-dissipativity holds. Finally, we discussed the finite-
horizon case and the case in which the non-unique con-
trol input solution results in non-unique state trajecto-
ries, such that some optimal solutions might be stabiliz-
ing while others not.
The interpretation of quadratic strict pre-dissipativity
in terms of solutions to optimal control problems estab-
lishes a strong connection with the seminal paper [25]
and suggests connections with some more recent con-
tributions in economic MPC, e.g., [34]. It is possible,
though arguably nontrivial, that our interpretation of
strict dissipativity in terms of optimal control can be car-
ried over to the full nonlinear case. Such investigations
will be the subject of future research.
