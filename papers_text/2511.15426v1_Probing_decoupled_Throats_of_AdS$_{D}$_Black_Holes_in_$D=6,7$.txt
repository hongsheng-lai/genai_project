Abstract:
The Kerr/CFT correspondence establishes a relationship between
extremal black holes in higher dimensions and a chiral conformal field theory (CFT) in
their near-horizon limit. A generalization of this framework, known as the EVH/CFT
correspondence, has been developed for four- and five-dimensional AdS black holes. It
was further proposed in [1] that a generalized duality between (D −2) dimensional
geometry and (D −3) dimensional field theory may emerge in AdSD=6,7 black holes
under a suitably defined extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit. In this work, we
demonstrate that the near-EVH geometries arising in these AdS6,7 black hole models
are not of the standard lower dimensional AdS kinds of black holes to establish a
lower dimensional version of AdS/CFT correspondence, but instead belong to the
family of Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton (EMMD) gravity theories. This realization
opens a pathway toward a microscopic counting of non-AdS black hole entropy via
higher-dimensional AdS/CFT techniques.

Introduction
So far, all gravitational-wave observations of black hole mergers have been consistent
with the Kerr model of black holes [2]. Understanding the quantum effects associated
with Kerr black holes is therefore crucial for uncovering potential signatures of quantum
gravity.
One of the major observational milestones to date is the confirmation of
Hawking’s area theorem [3], which states that the total event-horizon area of black
holes cannot decrease over time. In particular, recent observations verify that the final
horizon area after a merger exceeds the sum of the areas of the two initial black holes
[4].
The problem of understanding the microscopic states of black holes is a cornerstone
test for any candidate theory of quantum gravity. Two main approaches have been
developed to study this problem in different frameworks.
• The AdS3/CFT2 correspondence provides a particularly transparent setting, as
the powerful Virasoro symmetry completely determines the microscopic states
of black holes in the near-horizon region [5, 6]. This idea was later generalized
– 1 –


to higher-dimensional extremal black holes through the Kerr/CFT correspon-
dence [7] (also generalized as the extremal black hole/CFT correspondence [8–
10]). These theories assert that the generic AdS2 geometry emerging in the near-
horizon limit of extremal black holes admits boundary conditions under which a
Virasoro algebra governs the dynamics, without acknowledging the details of the
higher dimensional black hole in the UV1.
• Within the AdSd+1/CFTd (d = D −1 > 2) framework, the microscopic states
of AdS black holes can be reproduced by counting gauge-invariant operators in
the dual superconformal field theories. Remarkable progress has been achieved in
understanding black holes in AdS4 [12–15], AdS5 [16–19], AdS6 [13, 20], and AdS7
[18, 21–23]. See [24] for a recent review. Most of these studies focus on BPS black
holes, for which the counting of gauge-invariant states in the dual weakly coupled
field theory remains valid. An exception is the work [25], which investigates the
field computation to understand the entropy of the near-BPS AdS5 black holes.
The two approaches were investigated in a unified framework within the BPS black
hole in the AdSD spacetimes. There are two possible perspetives being considered in
the literature. One is to consider the gravitational Cardy limits [26] where the charges
and angular momenta are rescaled to make the black hole ultra spinning. The geometry
in these limits are generically AdS2 and AdS3, where Virasoro algebra can determine
the dynamics in the near horizon limit. Another is building on earlier studies of the
Extremal Vanishing Horizon (EVH) limit of black holes [27–31] and explore the AdS5
black holes in the BPS-EVH limits [1]. In the EVH limit, the black hole area S0 ∼A
is taken to zero while the central charge c diverges, such that the product cA remains
fixed. Given the expansion of entropy S in terms of temperature T is
S(T, Qi, Ja) = S0(Qi, Ja) + S1(Qi, Ja)T + S2(Qi, Ja)T 2 + · · · ,
(1.1)
the dynamics of the extremal black hole can be activated in this limit by taking S0 = 0,
thereby circumventing the instability problem associated with AdS2 geometry [32],
and the geometry is elevated to AdS3 if S1 ̸= 0. In the supersymmetric AdS5 black
hole model [1], an extremal pinched BTZ black hole emerges in the near-EVH regime,
consistent with S ∼T relations. Moreover, since the microscopic states of the AdS5
black hole can be computed via the superconformal indices of N = 4 SYM, the authors
of [1] demonstrated that a Cardy-like formula—used to count the degeneracy of an
emergent CFT2 [33]—can be derived from the inverse Laplace transformation of the
1There are also extensions of this idea to non-extremal black holes, where the Virasoro symmetry
is realized as a geometric symmetry of the phase space of perturbations [11].
– 2 –


N = 4 superconformal indices. This work represents a significant step toward proving
the Kerr/CFT correspondence from the perspective of AdS/CFT, at least in the BPS
limit. However, neither of these works can be considered as completing the proof of
Kerr/CFT from AdS/CFT, as the mechanism of the emergent Virasoro algebra is still
unclear.
An interesting generalization of EVH-BPS black holes proposed in [1] is the emer-
gent EVH configurations in the IR limit of AdS6 [34] and AdS7 black holes [35, 36].
These black holes can be appropriately embedded in the ten dimensional string theory
and eleven dimensional M-theory [37, 38]. The extremal limit of higher dimensional
AdS black holes require more charges and angular momenta to support [8, 39, 40]. This
is due to the gravitational interactions of higher dimensions are stronger which requires
more gauge forces or rotations to balance to get extremal black hole.
On the other hand, with more charges and spatial dimensions are present, we might
expect (1.1) can have higher orders of scalings S ∼T 2 or S ∼T 3 by fine tuning the
charges and angular momenta i.e. make S0(Qi, Ja) = S1(Qi, Ja) = 0. However, we will
clarify that near-EVH black holes in rotating AdS6 and AdS7 can be defined without
being restricted to the near-BPS limit, as previously proposed in [1], and can instead
be realized through general near-extremal limits.
We carefully examine the scaling
relations between entropy S and temperature T for these black holes. Our analysis
shows that their near-horizon geometries, both in D = 6 and 7, can be universally
described by solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell–Maxwell–Dilaton (EMMD) theory in
lower dimensions (including Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole at special points). These
black holes emergent from EVH limits are no longer with AdS asymptotics. However,
as the microscopic states of the supersymmetric AdS6,7 black holes can be reproduced
from the dual SCFT, we should in principle to use the higher dimensional SCFT to
understand the quantum states dual to these EMMD black holes.
This can be an
essential step to understand holographic duals to non-AdS black holes.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the concept of near-
EVH limits for Kerr–AdS5 black holes based on [1, 29]. In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we
investigate the near-EVH phases in AdS6 and AdS7 black holes, respectively, within
this EMMD framework. Specifically, for AdS6, the near-EVH geometry corresponds
to a four-dimensional EMMD black hole with S ∼T 2. In AdS7, we find both S ∼T
and S ∼T 3 configurations, which are respectively realized as a BTZ black hole and a
five-dimensional EMMD black hole. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss the holographic
implications of these near-EVH limits, and conclude with discussions in Section 5.

Review of AdS5
Studies on the (near)-extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limits of AdS5 black holes
were initiated in [27, 31] for static R-charged black holes and further developed in [28].
Subsequent investigations into the EVH limits of Kerr–RN–AdS5 black holes and their
dual field theory interpretations began with [29], while an index-based interpretation
of the emergent IR CFT2 and its entropy was later provided in [1]. Generic AdS5 black
holes in U(1)3 gauged supergravity carry three charges and two angular momenta. The
most general non-supersymmetric solution of this type was constructed in [41], building
on earlier works [42–46]. However, the full generality of these solutions makes them
rather complicated. For the purpose of capturing the essential physics of near-EVH
limits and their holographic interpretation via superconformal indices [1], the simpler
special solutions presented in [29, 44] suffice. We therefore restrict our analysis to these
special cases.
The black hole solution under consideration, studied in [1, 10], carries two equal
charges and is described by the following five-dimensional metric:

This solution is parametrized by four independent parameters (a, b, m, q) and we have
set the cosmological constant g = 1. Here Newton constant G is related to the rank of
SU(N) gauge group of N = 4 SYM by
π
2GN = N 2. These expressions fully characterize
the thermodynamic state of the black hole. The solution and its thermodynamic data
play a central role in the subsequent analysis of the near-EVH limit and the emergence
of an effective two-dimensional conformal description.
The EVH and near-EVH limits are defined as [29] 2
EVH : a = r+ = 0 ;
near-EVH : a = λϵ2,
r = ϵx
(2.3)
where ϵ →0 is taken as also the near horizon limits. The EVH is treated as the ground
state while the near-EVH limits can be treated as excitation states of the theory, as
it has non-vanishing temperature of order ϵ. The corresponding geometries of (near)-
EVH limits are respectively pinched AdS3 and BTZ black holes. The entropy of these
BTZ black hole scales as S ∼N 2ϵ, which is finite as we keep N 2ϵ fixed as N →∞.
For the classical description of gravity to be valid, N 2ϵ should be taken large.
We are especially interested in the near-EVH limit combined with the BPS condi-
tion, which includes both the supersymmetry
E = Ja + Jb + Q1 + Q2 + Q3
(2.4)
The chemical potentials satisfying the supersymmetry condition are generically com-
plex, and it is useful to define following chemical potentials:
∆i = β(1 −Φi),
ωI = β(1 −ΩI) ,
i = 1, 2, 3;
I = 1, 2
(2.5)
2The EVH limit is defined as b = r+ = 0 in [1] which is still valid in q = 0 limit. Due to the
symmetry between a, b parameters, this will not change the essential physics.

and is subject to the linear constraint:
∆1 + ∆2 + ∆3 −ωa −ωb = 2πi .
(2.6)
This makes the parameters (q, m) are generically complex unless the radius of horizon
is determined by
r2

1 + a + b .
(2.7)
This condition removes the closed timelike curves in the spacetime.
The solutions
satisfying both the supersymmetry condition (2.4) and the horizon size condition (2.7)
have real values of charges and entropy, parametrized by the (q, m) parameters as
q = (a + b)(1 + a)(1 + b)
1 + a + b
,
m = (a + b)2(1 + a)(1 + b)(2 + a + b)
2(1 + a + b)
.

We are now ready to explain the entropy (2.9) of the BPS-EVH black hole from
the computations of the dual N = 4 SYM (2.12), following [1]. It has been shown in
– 6 –


various works [16–19, 47] that the entropy functional in the large N limit of N = 4
SYM is
S = ln Z + (Ja + Q3)ωa + (Jb + Q3)ωb + (Q1 −Q3)∆1 + (Q2 −Q3)∆2 + 2πiQ3
ln Z = N 2

∆1 + ∆2 + ∆3 −ω1 −ωb = 2πi
(2.13)
where the chemical potentials are taken complex to avoid cancellation between bosonic
and fermionic degrees of freedom [48]. After performing saddle point approximation
on the chemical potentials ∆i, ωa, ωb, the entropy functional (2.13) reproduces the BPS
black hole entropy [46]
S = 2π
r
Q1Q2 + Q1Q3 + Q2Q3 −N 2

(2.14)
The entropy formula (2.14) is consistent with the one for two equal charge black hole
(2.2) in the BPS limit. Therefore, the BPS-EVH limit of the entropy (2.9) should
be also encoded in the superconformal indices of the N = 4 SYM, and the entropy
functional (2.13).
In fact, as shown in [1], the near-EVH limit splits the extremization of the entropy
functional in the saddle-point approximation into two steps. In the large-N limit with
the EVH condition N 2ϵ held fixed, the charges scale as Q3 ∼Ja ∼N 2ϵ2, while Q1,2 ∼
Jb ∼N 2. Under this scaling, the saddle-point approximation of the functional in (2.13)
is justified only for ∆1,2 and ωb, but not for ωa. Therefore, setting ∆1 = ∆2 = ∆in the
solution (2.1) and performing the ωb and ϕ integrations first, we obtain

(2.15)
where ˆ∆and ˆωb denote the values of the chemical potentials satisfying the saddle-
point equations. This expression (2.15) closely resembles the Cardy formula of a two-
dimensional CFT. It may be viewed as a functional over the rescaled modulus ˜ωa = ϵωa.
Since N 2ϵ is fixed and large, extremization over ˜ωa is valid and reproduces precisely
the near-EVH entropy given in (2.9).
This computation strongly supports the emergence of an effective two-dimensional
conformal field theory in the near-horizon limit. The resulting EVH 2D CFT is closely
related to the Kerr/CFT correspondence, though their central charges differ by a fac-
tor of
√
2 — a discrepancy that may stem from differing choices of time coordinates
between AdS5 and AdS3 [1]. This result should therefore be viewed as a key first step to-
ward uncovering the microscopic mechanism underlying the Kerr/CFT correspondence
within the framework of AdS/CFT.
– 7 –


However, this does not constitute sufficient evidence to claim that the EVH/CFT
correspondence (as a more special version of Kerr/CFT correspondence) has been de-
rived from AdS/CFT. First, although the central charge in the Cardy formula matches
that of Kerr/CFT, its origin on the field theory side remains obscure. It is unclear how
this central charge, which is geometrically defined by the AdS2 throat in the gravity
picture, can be derived from the algebraic data of N = 4 SYM, such as the conformal
dimensions of operators or the central charge of N = 4 SYM. Second, it is not under-
stood how operators transforming under the 4D superconformal algebra PSU(2, 2|4)
organize into representations of the Virasoro algebra3. This conceptual tension is re-
flected in the mismatch between the local symmetries of AdS5 in the UV and AdS3 in
the IR. Despite these aspects, we are not aware of whether the general SL(3, Z) families
of AdS black hole corresponding to the root of unity configurations [49–58] can have
such a near-EVH decoupling limit or not. These topics will not be discussed in this
paper.

AdS black holes in D = 6, 7
AdSD black holes in D = 6 and 7 dimensions exhibit considerably richer structure
than their four- and five-dimensional counterparts. Of particular interest are those
solutions that either possess known holographic duals or admit consistent embeddings
into string theory. Notable examples include AdS6 black holes with two independent
angular momenta and one R-charge [34], as well as AdS7 black holes carrying up to
three angular momenta and two distinct R-charges [36].
This classification closely
mirrors the properties of superconformal field theories in d = 5 and 6 dimensions [59].
Moreover, such black hole solutions are of intrinsic interest due to their realizations as
specific brane configurations in string theory or M-theory [37, 38].
The metric of AdSD is expressed in coordinates including time t, a radial coordinate
r, along with [D−1
2 ] azimuthal angles ϕi and [D−2
2 ] latitude coordinates yα on the sphere.
To be precise, we set D = 2n + 1 for odd dimensions and D = 2n for even dimensions.
The coordinates yα are related to the direction cosines µi of the unit sphere S[D/2] via
the Jacobi transformation:

3Evidence suggests that the emergence of the Virasoro algebra in the near-EVH limit is tied to
the chiral algebra mechanism [1], since one of the constituents of the Virasoro generators Ja + Q3 is
a Schur operator. However, the set of letters contributing to the entropy and transforming under the
Virasoro algebra also includes non-Schur operators. Therefore, a generalization of the chiral algebra
mechanism appears necessary to account for the Virasoro symmetry emerging in near-EVH limits.

i = 1. Here, each ai parametrizes
a rotation in the corresponding ϕi direction. The symbol Q′ indicates that the product
omits any vanishing factor. In the case of even D, we set an = 0. This coordinate sys-
tem, introduced in [40], provides a natural framework for generalizing Kerr–AdS black
holes to include NUT charges. It also offers several structural advantages: for example,
the metric on SD−2 becomes diagonal in these coordinates, and the coordinates yα and
r appear in a highly symmetric manner throughout the metric.
In this section, we will describe the corresponding near-(EVH) limits of the AdSD
black holes with D = 6, 7. The analysis on the thermodynamics of these black holes
indicate they have S ∼T D−3 scaling relations in the near BPS and near EVH limits
[1]. These scaling relations between entropy and temperature was conjectured to hint
a possible AdSD−2/CFTD−3 duality emergent in the IR. In this section, we will mainly
make two clarifications in these models.
• The near-BPS condition is not necessary to define the near EVH limits
• The near-EVH geometry is not of the AdSD−2 black holes, but instead the black
holes in EMMD theories in (D −2) dimensional manifold.

form potential and together with the gauge potential of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. The

We are particularly interested in the (near)-EVH limit, where the extremal black
hole horizon scales as ϵ and N
5
2ϵ2 is held fixed to ensure the presence of non-trivial
dynamics. In this framework, the exact EVH limit corresponds to the ground state of
the near-EVH geometry, characterized by a vanishing horizon. Achieving such a config-
uration requires careful tuning of parameters, especially since in spacetime dimensions
D ≥6 , the existence of extremal AdS black holes generally demands additional charges
and angular momenta to balance the gravitational potential.
The EVH limits are generically defined as
a ≡0,
r = ϵx,
r+ = ϵx+,
˜t = ϵτ
q = 0,
(3.9)
The blackening factor has a vanishing horizon by taking these parameters:
X(r) = (r2 + b2)(r2 + 1)r2
(3.10)
indicating that the limit results in the ground state geometry. However, the function Y
and coordinate y in the metric (3.4) vanish as the definition domain (3.6), while ˜ϕ1 is
singular in the EVH limit (3.9). They thus need to be appropriately normalized. The
solution adapted to both the definition domain (3.6) and the Jacobi transformation
(3.1) in this EVH limit is:
y = a cos θ1,
z = b cos θ2,
a ˜ϕ1 = −ϕ1

A special limit is z →b where the geometry is manifestly decoupled as global AdS4
spanned by (˜t, r, θ1, ϕ1) with S2 compact manifold spanned by (θ2, ϕ2).
We are now in a position to explore the near-EVH limit. This limit is implemented
via the following scalings
a = λϵ2,
q = bx+ϵ + q(3)ϵ3
(3.13)
together with the coordinate transformation (3.11) such that the range (3.6) is pre-
served. The scaling between a and ϵ was enlightened as possible generalizations of
the near-EVH limits in the AdS5 black hole counterparts [1]. q(3) has to be chosen to
guarantee the existence of the extremal horizon, where the temperature vanishes. The
temperature T does not vanish at the order ϵ for generic values of q(3), which results in
S ∼T 2 scaling relations:
S =

T = −2bx+q(3) + (3 + 4b + 3b2)x4

ϵ + O(ϵ3)
(3.14)
Therefore, the near-EVH scaling relations are possible even without the near-BPS con-
dition proposed in [1]. In the near-EVH limit, our interesting dynamics is restricted
to
ϵ2
G ∼N

2ϵ2
fixed,
ϵ →0
(3.15)
Despite that the S ∼T 2 scaling relations is not that special EVH limit, the particular
scaling of a with ϵ was motivated by potential generalizations of near-EVH limits in the
context of AdS5 black holes [1]. Meanwhile, the scaling of q with ϵ is chosen to ensure
the persistence of an extremal horizon in the limit. Moreover, this ansatz naturally
incorporates near-BPS EVH limits without further adjustment.
The BPS limit of AdS6 black hole and the field theory interpretation was discussed
in [13]. The supersymmetry condition yields
E = Ja + Jb + Q
(3.16)
– 12 –


Similar to AdS5 [1, 63], the q parameter satisfying the supersymmetry condition are
generically complex unless the BPS values of horizon size r0 is taken :

ωb = lim
r+→r0 β(1 −Ωb)
(3.18)
which are generically complex and subject to the condition
ωa + ωb −3∆= 2πi .
(3.19)
This condition will be crucial to reproduce the black hole entropy from the supercon-
formal indices, as will be discussed in section 4. As the generalization of EVH-BPS
limit of AdS5, the work [1] considered the combined near-BPS and near-EVH limits of
AdS6 black hole, where the horizon size reduces to
x+ =

1 + b
(3.20)
Besides the entropy of the black hole in the BPS limit is
S =

3GN(1 −b2)ϵ2
(3.21)
which is kept finite in the near-EVH limit. This is precisely a special case of near-
extremal black hole (3.14).
The near-EVH metric with extremality corresponding to the condition (3.13) is 5:

5The temperature of extremal black hole must be zero. We need to choose q(3) in (3.13) appropri-
ately to make T identically vanishing. Although any choices will not affect the leading order in the
near-EVH limit of the AdS6 black holes.

The decoupled geometry behaves differently for different locations of θ2.
We thus
consider two limits respectively. In the θ2 →0 limit (3.12), the four dimensional black
hole decoupled from the IR limit of AdS6 black hole is spanned by the coordinates
(τ, x, w, ϕ1), whose metric takes the following ansatz

Although the S2 parts are not fully decoupled from radial coordinate, the dynamical
part of the geometry of order ϵ2 is of the standard form of four dimensional Reissner-
Nordstr¨om (RN) black hole. The decoupled metric at locations defined by other values
of θ2 are still of the form (3.24).
Typically, the metric (3.24) is conformal to the extremal EMMD black hole solu-
tions [64, 65], which will also be reviewed in appendix A. For instance, the EMMD
solution with N1 = N2 = 2 is:
ds2
EMMD = ˜r + q2
˜r + q1

−(˜r −µ)˜r
(˜r + q2)2dt2 + (˜r + q1)2
˜r(˜r −µ) d˜r2 + (˜r + q1)2(dθ2
1 + sin2 θ1dϕ2
1)

(3.26)
Without loss of generality, we assume q2 > q1. The metric inside the square bracket of
(3.26) is precisely the decoupled near-EVH geometry (3.24) by identifying
µ = 0,
x+ = q1,
x+
b = q2 −q1,
x = ˜r + q1 .
(3.27)
If BPS condition is imposed [1], the horizon size x+ and charge q are both fixed by the
rotation parameters, which will correspond to special values of two U(1) charges in the
EMMD theory.
This near-EVH limit of black holes can be further generalized to the non-extremal
models, whose decoupled geometry can be conformally related to the non-extremal
EMMD black holes. The corresponding near-EVH limit (3.13) should be replaced by
q = b√x+x−ϵ + q(3)ϵ3 ,
(3.28)

q1 + µ = x+,
x−= q1,
√x+x−
b
= q2 −q1,
x = ˜r + q1
(3.30)
We thus claim the four dimensional geometry decoupled from the near-EVH limit
is the EMMD black hole (3.26) and (3.29). The conformal factor can be considered to
be absorbed into the dilaton, related to the metric in different frames. Also we need to
emphasize that the four dimensional decoupled geometry we found are asymptotically
flat. This is different from the AdS3 geometry emergent from the near-EVH limit of
AdS5 black holes [1, 27–29]. The term contributing to the non-vanishing cosmological
constant might be present6, but they are suppressed by the near-EVH limit in the
leading order.

AdS7 black hole
The AdS7 black hole with two R-charges and three angular momenta will have more
fruitful parameter space. Such solutions are consistently reduced from D = 11 super-
gravity with S4 compact sphere [66–68]. The bosonic part of the Lagrangian of the

which includes all the known special solutions with one rotation turned off [69, 70],
equal charge [35] or equal angular momenta [71, 72]. The most general solution to 7d
gauged supergravity in the asymptotically static frame (t, r, y, z, ϕi) for i = 1, 2, 3 is

The parameterization in this metric differs slightly from those used in AdS5 and
AdS6 black hole solutions, where redefining the charge parameter as qI = 2ms2
I offers
considerable convenience. However, this simplification no longer applies to the AdS7
solution given in (3.32), due to the presence of the (c1 −c2) term in the blackening
factor. This expression becomes tractable only in the equal-charge case. The event
horizon is located at r+, defined as the largest root of U(r+) = 0. In AdS5,6 cases, one
can invert this relation to express m explicitly in terms of the horizon radius, leading
to a convenient form for the blackening factor. In contrast, for AdS7, the function U(r)
is quadratic in m, which significantly complicates such an inversion. This increased
complexity enriches the structure of the parameter space and opens up new possibilities
for exploring different EVH decoupling limits.
The thermodynamic quantities of AdS7 black hole (3.32) are then computed by

We are also interested in identifying possible (near)-EVH limits from these black
hole solutions. To systematically explore such limits, we adopt the following guidelines:
• The near-horizon limit is defined as ϵ →0, with the radial coordinate rescaled as
r = ϵx to render ϵ dimensionless.
• The entropy S and temperature T are assumed to scale with ϵ as
S ∼ϵn,
T ∼ϵm−n+1,
m, n ∈Z ,
(3.46)
which in turn fixes the scaling of the entropy function and the blackening factor:
S(r+) ∼ϵ2n+2,
U ′(r+) ∼ϵm .
(3.47)
For simplicity, we restrict our analysis to integer values of m and n.
Our tasks are to find the scaling of ai, qI parameters to match the possible (3.47), in
order to achieve the near-EVH scalings of entropy and temperature (3.46). In this
paper, we will only discuss S ∼T k for some integer k, which could be potentially
interpretable as field theory with scaling symmetry but excluding Lifshitz scaling [74]
or hyperscaling violation scalings [75]. Therefore, the possible solutions are
(m, n) = (1, 1) :
S ∼T
(m, n) = (2, 2) :

Within these choices, the S ∼T near-EVH limits are well-known to produce the
pinched BTZ like geomtries in the IR. Just as the near-EVH BTZ black holes emergent

N
charges and
one perturbative R-charge [27], the BTZ in the near-EVH of AdS7 black holes can
be supported by two angular momenta of order G−1
N
and one perturbative angular
momenta.
More nontrivial are the scalings S ∼T 2 and S ∼T 3. Previous analysis of the near-
EVH limit in AdS6 identifies S ∼T 2 as signaling the emergence of a D = 4 EMMD
black hole in the infrared. In AdS7, however, no suitable parameter regime exists that
realizes a consistent near-EVH limit with S ∼T 2. On the other hand, the case S ∼T 3
has previously been identified in the near-EVH limit of AdS7 black holes [1]. In the
following, we present the specific parameter choices that define each of these limits and
describe the corresponding infrared geometries.
Example: D = 3 decoupled geometry
It is observed [26, 40] AdS3 and BTZ geometry can appear in the near-horizon limits
of AdS7 black hole. Such limits can be achieved by taking two non-vanishing angular
momentum and treat the third angular momenta to be perturbative.
We can simply take the near-EVH limits as
sI ≡0,
a3 = r+ = 0,
r = ϵx,
(3.49)
while the near-EVH limits are defined as
a3 = λϵ2,
r+ = ϵx+ .
(3.50)
Notice these exactly reduce to the Kerr-AdS7 black holes [39, 40] and are inconsistent
with supersymmetry condition (3.42). Their thermodynamic quantities are

In string theory, the local AdS3 geometry arises as the near-horizon limit of a
bound state consisting of n1 D1-branes, n5 D5-branes, and momentum P along a com-
mon compact direction. The D1-branes, viewed as instantons within the D5-branes,
combine with the momentum charge to produce a two-dimensional conformal field the-
ory known as the D1–D5 CFT. This theory has central charge c = 6n1n5, which counts
the number of degrees of freedom in the bound state. We refer to [76] for a compre-
hensive review. In the context of R-charged AdS5 black holes, an local AdS3 geometry
similarly emerges in the near-EVH limit when two R-charges are present. The three
R-charges, corresponding to the Cartan generators of the SO(6) R-symmetry, repre-
sent different species of giant gravitons. The effective theory arising from two species
of giant gravitons—localized at their intersection—has degrees of freedom proportional
to the product of the two macroscopic R-charges, yielding a central charge c ∼Q1Q2
[27, 31]. Similarly, for Kerr–AdS7 black holes in the near-EVH limit, the central charge
of the dual CFT2 associated with the emergent AdS3 is proportional to the product of
two angular momenta:
c ∼l3 ∼a1a2 ∼J1J2 .
(3.56)
This suggests that the CFT2 dual to the emergent AdS3 resides on the intersection of
dual giant-like objects in AdS7 [77].

Example: D = 5 decoupled geometry
As the S ∼T 3 near-EVH limit exist in equal charged AdS black hole with three
distinct angular momenta, we can just take the equal charged solution [35] to examine
its near-EVH geometry for simplicity. Therefore, we take q = 2ms2
1 = 2ms2
2. Especially
in the BPS limit, the horizon size is completely fixed by rotation parameters (3.43).
Therefore, the EVH-BPS limit related to taking r+ ∼ϵ is completely fixed by the
scalings of rotation parameter, independent of whether charges are taken equal or not.
The EVH limit to approach S ∼T 3 is defined as
a1 = a2 = 0,
q = 0,
r = ϵx,
x+ = 0,
˜t = ϵτ .

At the location θ2 →0, the geometry decouples to global AdS5 spanned by (t, r, θ1, ϕ1,2)
and S2 spanned by (θ2, ϕ3). We take the [35] metric ansatz and the following near-EVH
limits
a1 = λ1ϵ2,
a2 = λ2ϵ2,
q = a3x2

confirming the existence of S ∼T 3 scaling in this limit for generic values of q(4). The
special value of q(4) making the temperature vanishing should be further checked. In
this paper, we will not go to this fine tuning values. The relations (3.62) are valid
even without imposing the BPS condition, thus generalizing the EVH-BPS limit of
AdS7 proposed in [1]. If supersymmetry condition is imposed, the horizon size x+ = x0

We now implement the near-EVH limits given in (3.60) for the AdS7 black hole

In the opposite limit θ2 →π

reduces to a five-dimensional Reissner–Nordstr¨om black hole. For generic values of θ2,
the resulting geometry retains a structure analogous to that of (3.66).
Moreover, the geometry in (3.66) is conformally related to a D = 5 EMMD black
hole with exponents (N1, N2) = (1, 2). In the extremal case, the latter takes the form
(cf. (A.15)):

As in the AdS6 case, the correspondence between the near-EVH limit of the AdS7 black

realized by modifying the near-EVH limits in (3.60) to include subleading corrections:

Discussion
The AdSD black holes in D = 6, 7 analyzed in this section exhibit an infrared scaling
relation S ∼T D−3, reflecting the emergence of an effective (D −2)-dimensional geom-
etry in the decoupling limit. We identify these geometries as EMMD black holes [64].
Furthermore, the rich parameter space of AdS7 allows three-dimensional BTZ geome-
tries to emerge in the decoupling limit as well. The decoupled geometries discussed in
this work can be viewed as specific ground states—analogous to AdS2—that encode the
ground-state degeneracy of the higher-dimensional black holes. A key distinction, how-
ever, is that the near-EVH limit permits excitations along additional directions, giving
rise to a lower-dimensional effective field theory.
In this picture, extremal EMMD
black holes—characterized by vanishing temperature—correspond to the ground states
of these lower-dimensional effective theories. A structural distinction also exists be-
tween the AdS3-type near-EVH geometry and the EMMD-type geometry. The former
corresponds to a pinched, locally AdS3 spacetime, in which the compact S1 direction
has period 2πϵ and the dr2 component remains of order ϵ0 [1, 29, 78]. In contrast, the
near-EVH limits of AdSD=6,7 exhibit a decoupling structure of the form
ds2
D = ϵ2ds2
EMMD + dΩ2
2
(3.71)
which resembles a class of non-relativistic geometries known as MpT spacetimes [79].
We will revisit these observations in Section 5.
Several limitations in our study deserve mention. First, we have restricted our
analysis to (near)-EVH limits in which the rotation parameters scale with ϵ as integer
powers, following the approach of [1, 29]. While most generic scaling choices do not yield
a well-defined decoupling limit with a smooth horizon geometry, it may be worthwhile
to explore more exotic scalings—such as those involving non-integer powers—which
could be dual to other decoupled sectors in the holographic field theory. Second, our
discussion has been confined to on-shell solutions of supergravity in D = 6, 7 [34,
35]. An interesting open question is whether these supergravity Lagrangians (3.2) and
– 24 –


(3.31) can be related off-shell to the EMMD theory Lagrangian, for example (A.1).
Such a connection would help clarify how EMMD theories emerge from fine-tuned
decoupled vacua of ten-dimensional string theory or 11D supergravity via specific brane
configurations.
As reviewed in Appendix A, the supergravity framework admits three distinct
classes of EMMD black hole geometries, labeled by a pair of integers (N1, N2) satisfying
N1 + N2 = 2(D −2)
D −3 .
(3.72)
For D > 5, this constraint cannot be satisfied by integer pairs—a fact that may be
related to the property that AdS7 black hole is the highest-dimensional AdS black
holes embeddable in string theory with a known superconformal field theory dual. For
lower dimensions, the possible integer pairs (taking N1 < N2 without loss of generality
due to symmetry) are:
D = 4 :
(N1, N2) = (2, 2),
(1, 3),
D = 5 :
(N1, N2) = (1, 2).
(3.73)
It remains unclear why, although the near-EVH limits of AdS6,7 black holes yield
EMMD black holes of types (2, 2) and (1, 2) respectively, while the (1, 3) type—to
the best of our knowledge—does not appear in the near-EVH limits studied here. It
is also possible that such a solution may emerge from the near-EVH limit of as-yet-
unknown supergravity solutions in D = 6 or 7, which would be an interesting direction
for future work.

Holography with S ∼T D−3
The entropy of BPS AdSD black holes is known from microstate counting in the dual
superconformal field theory [13, 20–23, 80]. These results can be applied to study the
entropy of the emergent (D −2)-dimensional geometries arising in the near-extremal
vanishing horizon (EVH) limit. Although the extremization of the entropy functional in
D = 6 and 7 exhibits certain similarities, it differs from the corresponding extremization
in the near-EVH limit of AdS5. This further confirms that the near-EVH decoupling
geometry in D = 6, 7, with entropy scaling as S ∼T D−3, is not of BTZ type.
Consider the AdS6 black hole as an example. Its entropy is given by the functional
[13, 20]
S = i π
3GN
∆3

+ ϕQ + ωaJa + ωbJb + Λ(3∆−ωa −ωb + 2πi) ,

where Λ is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint among chemical potentials.
Extremizing this functional via the saddle-point approximation,
∂S
∂∆= ∂S
∂ωa
= ∂S
∂ωb
= 0 ,
(4.2)
simplifies the entropy expression to
S = 2πiΛ .
(4.3)
For the entropy to be real with real physical charges, Λ must be purely imaginary. This
leads to two constraint equations involving S [13]:

(4.6)
In the EVH limit Q = Ja = 0, the right-hand side vanishes identically, while the left-
hand side remains proportional to the entropy S. Thus, the entropy also vanishes in
this limit.
In the near-EVH limit given by (3.13) together with the BPS conditions, the en-
tropy expression (3.21) can also be reproduced by extremizing the functional in (4.1).
This mechanism differs significantly from that of the near-EVH entropy in AdS5 (see
(2.13)), where the entropy scales as N 2ϵ due to an extremization between terms of
order N 2 and N 2ϵ2, leading to the emergence of a 2D Cardy formula [1]. In the AdS6
case, the thermodynamic quantities scale as follows:

(4.7)
– 26 –


Since the angular momentum Ja is subleading compared to Jb and Q, it can be neglected
at leading order. Incorporating the near-EVH scaling relations (4.7) with the entropy
functional and the chemical potential constraint can be shown to correctly reproduce
the black hole entropy in the near-EVH limit (3.21).
The entropy of AdS7 black hole is reproduced by following functional [18, 24, 36, 63]

This can be derived from either 6d SCFT or the 5d N = 2 Yang-Mills theory on S5
[81]. The entropy evaluated as saddle point approximation is still captured by the
Lagrange multipler (4.3) due to the homogeneity of this functional. To have real values
of physical entropy with real charges and angular momenta, the entropy are determined
by two equations

(4.9)
In the exact EVH limit where J1,2 = Q = 0, the constraint (4.9) indicate the entropy
vanishing, consistent with the computation on gravity side. In the near-EVH limit
(3.60), the thermodynamic quantities scale with ϵ as
ω1 ∼ω2 ∼iπ,
∆∼ω3 ∼ϵ,
J1 ∼J2 ∼N 3ϵ4,
J3 ∼Q ∼N 3ϵ2,
(4.10)
Therefore, the contributions from angular momenta J1,2 are completely subleading in
the near-EVH limits as N 3ϵ3 is fixed. This phenomenon is similar to the extremization
of AdS6 entropy functional instead of AdS5, where the subleading angular momenta
are crucial to derive the Cardy formula.
A few remarks are in order.
• First, the contribution from the close to vanishing angular momenta is subleading,
resulting in an inhomogeneous entropy functional that does not separate into a
two-step extremization procedure—consistent with the fact that the near-EVH
geometry is not of BTZ type.
• Second, we propose that the entropy functional in the limit (4.7) should be in-
terpreted as that of an EMMD black hole. It is essential to note that EMMD
black holes do not carry angular momenta or support angular velocities [64]. To
– 27 –


establish this correspondence, the quantities in (4.7) must therefore be mapped
to the thermodynamic variables of EMMD black holes in the decoupled limit.
Furthermore, the explicit form of the EMMD metric exhibits a mild dependence
on the coordinate θ2, which is integrated out in the near-EVH black hole en-
tropy expressions (3.21) and (3.64). As a result, the near-EVH limit of the black
hole entropy effectively averages over a family of EMMD geometries, making the
matching between the EMMD black hole entropy and the near-EVH limit a more
subtle task. This additional degree of freedom may be absorbed into a redefinition
of the lower-dimensional Newton constant.
• Finally, The EVH limits are defined to have certain subset of charges and angular
momentum vanishing, which correspond to the enhanced supersymmetry. These
are equivalent to define appropriate subsectors of the superconformal field theories
dual to the AdS6,7 black holes.
All these holographic aspects, however, lie beyond the scope of the present work.

Conclusion and future work
In this work, we systematically explore possible near-horizon decoupled geometries
in higher-dimensional AdS black holes embedded in string theory and M-theory [38].
Thanks to their high dimensionality and rich parameter space, the D = 6, 7 black holes
support model-dependent decoupled EMMD geometries of dimension D ≥4, which
generalize the universal AdS2 throats appearing in the near-horizon limits of extremal
black holes. The analysis are restricted to the leading order of the near-EVH limits,
which might be invisible to the presence of the cosmological constant in the decoupled
EMMD geometries. Our main findings are summarized in Table 1:

The first open question is to understand the microscopic states dual to the classes of
decoupled EMMD black holes (3.24) and (3.66), which are asymptotically flat [64, 65].
The field theories dual to these black holes should be viewed as decoupled subsectors
– 28 –


in the higher dimensional dual SCFT in D = 5, 6 [20–22]. The decoupled subsectors
in these higher dimensional SCFTs however, are not as well-studied as the decoupled
subsectors of N = 4 SYM, which is known as the Spin Matrix theory [82–88]. Besides
the SCFT in D = 5, 6 and especially the 6d N = (2, 0) theory are far from being
understood as they lack of weak coupling descriptions [89].
The relevant works to
construct the Lagrangian description can be found in [90]. From the analysis of this
paper, we expect studying these decoupled subsectors of SCFTs in D = 5, 6 should be
holographically dual to the asymptotically flat EMMD black holes. These models thus
propose a new algorithm, to use higher dimensional AdS/CFT models where the flat
black holes are embedded in to understand the microscopic states of non-AdS black
hole, providing an example of holography beyond the AdS/CFT correspondence.
Analytic solutions for black objects in higher dimensions are more readily available
in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Notable examples include the Myers–Perry black
holes with the maximal number of independent rotations [91], the Cvetic–Youm solu-
tion incorporating U(1) charges in arbitrary dimensions [92], as well as solutions with
nontrivial topologies such as black rings [93–95] and black saturns [96]. For compre-
hensive reviews, we refer to [97]. These nontrivial configurations may give rise to even
richer geometric structures in the near-EVH regime [98, 99].
Unlike AdS5 black hole, whose near horizon limits are pinched AdS3/BTZ geometry,
the near EVH limits of AdSD=6,7 black holes are of the following forms
ds2
D = ϵ2Ω× ds2
EMMDD−2 + ds2
S2
(5.1)
where Ωis a conformal factor. These kinds of geometries are similar to the recently
found MpT geometries which are generalizations of the non-relativistic Newton-Cartan
geometry to make the Dp-brane actions have well-defined non-relativistic limits [79,
100]. The form of decoupled geometry (5.1) in the near-EVH limits of AdS6,7 enlightens
that we can study them from the perspectives of non-relativistic strings and branes.
They might provide a non-perturbative configurations in non-relativistic string theory
with finite temperature.
The EMMD geometries emerging in the near-EVH limits of AdSD black holes are
specific to particular gauged supergravity models, whereas AdS2 throats universally
appear in the near-horizon region of near-extremal black holes. Although finite-energy
excitations break the strict AdS2 boundary conditions, their dynamics are universally
captured by Jackiw–Teitelboim (JT) gravity—a nearly AdS2 theory proposed to be dual
to the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model [101–105]. This framework accounts for the
linear term S1T in the low-temperature entropy expansion S = S0 +S1T; see [106, 107]
for pedagogical treatments. Extensions to three dimensions have also been explored,
providing a higher-dimensional analogue of the near-AdS2/SYK correspondence [108].

These developments have further been applied to study the dynamics of near-BPS AdS5
black holes and to identify mass gaps [109]. In our context, the EMMD black holes
serve as novel low-energy effective geometries in the infrared, characterized by higher
power-law scalings S ∼T D−3. They may similarly be understood as gravitational duals
to strongly coupled low-energy sectors, much like higher-dimensional generalizations of
the SYK model capturing nontrivial infrared dynamics.

A
Review of EMMD gravity
In this section, we provide a brief review of the Einstein–Maxwell–Maxwell–Dilaton
gravity model investigated in [64, 65]. The Lagrangian of the D-dimensional super-
gravity under investigation is given by
1
eL = R −1
2(∂ϕ)2 −1
4ea1ϕF 2
1 −1
4ea2ϕF 2
2 −V (ϕ),
(A.1)
where a1 and a2 are dilaton coupling constants. To obtain analytic solutions in this
supergravity theory, it is convenient to parameterize the couplings as
a2
1 = 4
N1
−2(D −3)
D −2 ,
a2
2 = 4
N2
−2(D −3)
D −2 ,
(A.2)
with Ni being positive integers in the context of supergravity. Our focus lies particularly
on black hole solutions that satisfy
a1a2 = −2(D −3)
D −2 .
(A.3)
Under this condition, analytic solutions carrying two independent charges can be con-
structed, as shown in [64].

subject to the constraints
N1a1 + N2a2 = 0,
N1 + N2 = 2(D −2)
D −3
(A.5)
In four dimensions (D = 4), the possible solutions include (N1, N2) = (2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1),
while in three dimensions (D = 5) the only admissible pairs are (N1, N2) = (2, 1), (1, 2).
We now examine each of these cases in turn.
D = 4 geometry with (N1, N2) = (2, 2)
This symmetric choice of parameters, with a1 = −a2 = 1, yields a particularly simple
and elegant solution. Defining the charge parameters as
q1 = µs2
1,
q2 = µs2
2 ,
(A.6)
the metric in (A.4) simplifies to
ds2 = −
r(r −µ)
(r + q1)(r + q2)dt2 + (r + q1)(r + q2)
r(r −µ)
dr2 + (r + q1)(r + q2)dΩ2
2
(A.7)
To reveal its underlying conformal structure, we can factor the metric.
Assuming
without loss of generality that q2 −q1 = q > 0, it can be recast into the form
ds2 = r + q2
r + q1

−(r −µ)r
(r + q2)2dt2 + (r + q1)2
r(r −µ) dr2 + (r + q1)2dΩ2
2

(A.8)
This conformal representation highlights how the solution interpolates between different
geometries but with the same asymptotic, with the prefactor playing a crucial role.

D = 4 geometry with (N1, N2) = (1, 3)
Due to the symmetry in the indices of N1 and N2, it is sufficient to analyze the (1, 3)
case, as the (3, 1) solution is its direct counterpart. The corresponding dilaton couplings
are fixed as
a1 =
√
3,
a2 = −1
√
3 .
(A.9)
In this asymmetric configuration, the metric (A.4) becomes
ds2 = −
r(r −µ)
p
(r + q1)(r + q2)3dt2 +
p
(r + q1)(r + q2)3
r(r −µ)
dr2 +
p
(r + q1)(r + q2)3dΩ2
2
(A.10)
Expressing this metric in a conformally rescaled frame provides a clearer geometric
interpretation:
ds2 =
rr + q1
r + q2

−
r(r −µ)
(r + q1)(r + q2)dt2 + (r + q2)2dr2
r(r −µ)
+ (r + q2)2dΩ2
2

(A.11)
D = 5 geometry with (N1, N2) = (1, 2)
We now turn to a five-dimensional example characterized by (N1, N2) = (1, 2). The
associated dilaton couplings are given by
a1 =
r
8
3,
a2 =
r
2
3 .
(A.12)
The full metric in this case reads
ds2 = −
r2(r2 −µ)dt2
(r2 + q1)
2
3(r2 + q2)
4
3 + (r2 + q1)
1
3(r2 + q2)
2
3
r2 −µ
dr2 + (r2 + q1)
1
3(r2 + q2)
2
3dΩ2
3
(A.13)
A clearer picture of the geometry emerges after performing the coordinate transforma-
tion
x2 = r2 + q1,
q = q2 −q1 > 0 .
(A.14)
In these new coordinates, the metric simplifies to the following conformally flat form:
ds2 = (x2 + q)
2
3
x
4
3

−(x2 −q1)(x2 −q1 −µ)dt2
(x2 + q)2
+
x4dx2
(x2 −q1)(x2 −q1 −µ) + x2dΩ2
3

(A.15)
This final form reduces to the standard five dimensional RN-black hole by taking q = 0.
