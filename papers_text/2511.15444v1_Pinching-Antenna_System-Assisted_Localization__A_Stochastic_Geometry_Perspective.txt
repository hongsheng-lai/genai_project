Abstract—This paper proposes a novel localization framework
underpinned by a pinching-antenna (PA) system, in which the
target location is estimated using received signal strength (RSS)
measurements obtained from downlink signals transmitted by the
PAs. To develop a comprehensive analytical framework, we em-
ploy stochastic geometry to model the spatial distribution of the
PAs, enabling tractable and insightful network-level performance
analysis. Closed-form expressions for target localizability and the
Cram´er–Rao lower bound (CRLB) distribution are analytically
derived, enabling the evaluation of the fundamental limits of
PA-assisted localization systems without extensive simulations.
Furthermore, the proposed framework provides practical guid-
ance for selecting the optimal waveguide number to maximize
localization performance. Numerical results also highlight the
superiority of the PA-assisted approach over conventional fixed-
antenna systems in terms of the CRLB.

I. INTRODUCTION
P
INCHING-antenna (PA) systems have garnered signifi-
cant attention in recent years due to their reconfigurability
and practical deployment potential [1]. Compared to traditional
multiple-antenna systems, a PA system comprises multiple
discrete dielectric particles, referred to as PAs, that are pinched
on dielectric waveguides to facilitate signal transmission.
Equally importantly, DOCOMO demonstrated in [2] that a
PA system can be implemented in a cost-effective manner.
Motivated by these promising characteristics, PA systems have
been extensively studied in the literature to enhance com-
munication functionality. The fundamental performance limits
of PA systems under various network configurations were
thoroughly examined in [3], demonstrating that a PA system
can achieve significant performance gains over conventional
antenna systems. In addition, a distinguishing feature of PA
systems is the reconfigurability of the PAs. By adjusting their
positions along the waveguide, the system can simultaneously
serve multiple mobile users and enhance communication per-
formance by minimizing the distance between each user and
its associated PA.
Due to the advantages of PA systems, recent studies have in-
vestigated their potential to improve localization performance.
For instance, Ding [4] analyzed the fundamental limits of a
PA-assisted time-of-arrival (ToA) localization system in terms
of the Cram´er–Rao lower bound (CRLB), demonstrating that
the use of PAs can significantly reduce localization error.
Khalili et al. [5] investigated the large-scale deployment of
waveguides to improve target diversity and sensing perfor-
mance. Qin et al. [6] investigated how a PA system can be
used to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems in terms of communication
and sensing rates, whereas the inner and outer bounds of
the achievable communication–sensing rate region were de-
rived in [7] to gain insights into the information-theoretic
limits of PA-assisted ISAC systems. Although PA systems
have demonstrated strong potential in enhancing sensing and
localization performance, a significant challenge cannot be
overlooked when applying them to target localization. The
sparse deployment of PAs along dielectric waveguides may
limit their ability to capture a wide range of signals transmitted
by mobile users. The signal reception on a single waveguide
equipped with multiple PAs can lead to significant inter-
antenna coupling, which lowers the localization accuracy. To
address this issue, prior works, such as [8] and [9], have
proposed the usage of additional antenna arrays or leaky
coaxial cables (LCCs) to capture echo signals reflected by the
target for channel estimation and target localization.
From a practical implementation perspective, this work con-
siders received signal strength (RSS)-based localization within
a PA system, where multiple PAs transmit downlink signals
to the target for localization.1 In addition, to the best of our
knowledge, existing studies on PA system-assisted localization
primarily focus on system-level or link-level designs and fail
to provide insights into how different system configurations
affect the overall localization performance. Motivated by this
limitation, we aim to develop a stochastic geometric frame-
work that studies the impact of the spatial distribution of PAs
on the localization performance, thereby enabling network-
level performance analysis and system optimization. The main
contributions of this paper are listed as follows:
1) Stochastic Modeling of the PA System: A unified evalu-
ation framework is developed using stochastic geometry,
providing valuable insights into the design of PA-assisted
localization systems from a network-level perspective.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage the
Poisson line process (PLP) for analyzing the localization
performance of PA systems.
2) Localizability and CRLB: To assess whether the mobile
user (target) can be localized with a sufficient signal-
to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), the target local-
izability is investigated. Tractable expressions for the
1Different from ToA- and angle-of-arrival (AoA)-based localization, which
typically require wideband signals or antenna arrays to obtain range and angle
measurements, RSS-based localization offers a lower-complexity alternative
by eliminating the need for such hardware and reducing the burden of
acquiring location-dependent features [10].

CRLB and its distribution are then derived, offering valu-
able insights into how network configurations and channel
characteristics influence the localization performance.
3) Guideline for System Design: A comprehensive evalua-
tion is conducted to gain insights into the fundamen-
tal limits of PA-assisted localization. Numerical results
show that the PA-assisted system achieves significantly
improved localization accuracy compared to that of us-
ing uniform linear arrays (ULAs). In addition, the pro-
posed stochastic geometric framework offers practical
guidelines for optimizing the number of waveguides
and configuring network parameters to meet the desired
localization requirements.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a localization problem (see 1) in a two-
dimensional (2D) space, where multiple PAs on waveguides
transmit downlink signals to a target user for localization.
A. Network Model
According to Slivnyak’s theorem [11], we assume that
the target pt = [xt yt]T is located at the origin O, while
the waveguides are randomly distributed within a 2D disk
with center point at the origin and radius Ra according to
a PLP with line density λl. Specifically, the k-th waveguide is
modeled by an undirected line Lk, which is: Lk(ρk, θk) =

(x, y) ∈R2 : x cos θk + y sin θk = ρk
	
, where ρk denotes
the perpendicular distance from the origin O to the k-th waveg-
uide, while θk is its inclination angle. During localization,
the m-th PA on waveguide k is activated from the predefined
locations (pk,m = [xk,m yk,m]T , where k = 1, 2, . . . and m =
0, 1, . . .), while the predefined locations on the waveguide are
modeled by a one-dimensional (1-D) homogeneous Poisson
point process (HPPP) with node density λs. By indexing the
waveguides in ascending order of their perpendicular distance
ρk from the target, the probability density function (PDF) and
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the distance ρk to
the k-th nearest waveguide are [12]
fρk(x) = e−2πλlx(2πλlx)k
x(k −1)!

Let dk,1 = ∥pk,1 −pt∥, where ∥· ∥denotes the Euclidean
norm, be the distance between the target and the nearest PA
(m = 1) on the k-th waveguide. Then, conditioned on ρk, the
PDF and CDF of dk,1 are, respectively, given by

B. Signal Model
Each waveguide activates its nearest PA to the target user,
denoted as pk,1, during the localization process. Although all
PAs serve the same target user for localization, the RSS sample
has to be extracted from a specific PA to obtain distance

information [10], [13]. Consequently, each PA on a differ-
ent waveguide transmits different symbols, which introduces
interference and compromises the localization performance.
For example, in cellular networks, the base station (BS)
transmits signals containing various types of information, such
as the cell-ID, that enable mobile users to extract location
information from the corresponding BS [13]. Thus, the signal
received at the target user is

where Pt is the transmit power at each PA, while sk,
where E{|sk|2} = 1, is the symbol transmitted by the k-th
waveguide, and E{·} is the expectation operation; hk,1 is the
channel gain between the target and its nearest PA on the k-th
waveguide, which is given by [3]

length, respectively. Also, wn is the additive white Gaussian

exponent. From (3) and (4), the SINR at the target associated
with its nearest PA on the k-th waveguide is

Ptη is the normalized

target and the PA can be achieved by adjusting the PA location,
the path-loss exponent typically ranges from 2 to 2.8 [13].
C. RSS Measurements
Considering a practical implementation of the PA-assisted
localization system, the RSS-based scheme is considered. By
assuming that the nearest predefined location on each waveg-
uide has been determined, the RSS measured by the target
user associated with the activated PA on the k-th waveguide
is [10], [13]
rRSS,k,1 = ln Pr,k,1 −ln η −ln Pt = −α ln dk,1 + np,

where Pr,k,1 is the received signal power at the target user
transmitted by the activated PA on the waveguide k, while np

k }. Note
that the value of α is normally obtained through field testing
and calibration campaigns [10]. By collecting sufficient RSS
measurements, the location estimate can be obtained using
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as described in [10].
III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
A. Target Localizability
To determine the target localizability, we evaluate the prob-
ability of detecting at least K waveguides during localization.
Since the successful reception from the activated PA on the
K-th nearest waveguide implies that all nearer waveguides are
within the detection range, we investigate the probability that
the SINR between the target and the selected PA on the K-th
nearest waveguide exceeds a given threshold τ, given by

To derive a closed-form expression of (6), the dominant
interference analysis is adopted [14, Assumption 1]. Specif-
ically, all interferers, except for the PA located on the nearest
waveguide to the target, are approximated by their mean
values. Then, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 1. Considering a PA system with multiple waveg-
uides, where the nearest predefined location to the target is
activated to transmit downlink signals for localization, the
probability of detecting at least K waveguides is

For RSS-based localization, at least three waveguides are
required to localize the target position without ambiguity
[10]. Proposition 1 characterizes the probability of success-
fully conducting the localization procedure and illustrates
how this metric is influenced by various network parameters.
Based on Proposition 1, the expected SINR is computed by:

where σRSS = σp

(11)
where tr(·) is the trace operation. In addition to deriving the
CRLB using only the RSS samples detected from the nearest
PA on each waveguide, the PA can be activated at different
timestamps at all predefined locations on the waveguide for
localization. In this case, the variables A, B, and C, can then
be updated as follows:

(12)
where M is the number of predefined locations on each
waveguide. By substituting (12) into (11), the RSS-based
CRLB, considering all predefined locations for PA activation,
can be obtained. However, (11) involves the random variables
xk,m, yk,m, and dk,m, which makes it challenging to derive
the distribution of the CRLB. Motivated by this challenge, we
employ the concept of mutual information to derive a tractable
approximation of the CRLB, as presented in the following.
Proposition 2. By assuming that K waveguides are selected
for localization, while each waveguide has M predefined PA
positions. Given the RSS disturbance σ2
p, the RSS CRLB can
be approximated by
CRLBRSS(pt) ≈σ2

(13)
where d∗∈{dk,m}K,M−1
k=1,m=0 is the selected distance between
the target user and the PA activated at the m-th predefined
location on the k-th waveguide. Considering a practical sce-
nario in which only a single PA on the waveguides is activated
for localization, we can set M = 1.
Proof. See Appendix II.
Compared to the lengthy and complex expression in (11),
the approximate CRLB presented in Proposition 2 provides
a concise and analytically tractable expression that effectively
captures the localization performance. This simplified form
serves as a valuable tool for performance evaluation without
relying on computationally intensive simulations. It shows that
(13) is a function of distance d∗, while the CDF of d∗is given
in (2). The conditional RSS-based CRLB distribution is
P (CRLBRSS(pt) ≤s| M, K, σ2

By substituting the CDF of d∗into (14), the CRLB distribution
for the PA system is obtained. Compared to conventional
analytical methods that assume a fixed network geometry,
the stochastic geometric framework accommodates random
network deployments. By leveraging the inherent randomness
of the considered PA system, the CRLB distribution provides
insights into how the number of waveguides and channel
parameters affect the overall localization performance across
all possible geometric configurations.
Although this study considers RSS for localization, it was
suggested in [4] that ToA measurements can be utilized for
target localization. However, the time synchronization among
the deployed waveguides cannot be overlooked during the
localization process. To mitigate this impact, time-difference-
of-arrival (TDoA) localization can be applied. In our previous
work [15], the approximate CRLB for the TDoA-based local-
ization is: CRLBTDoA(pt) ≈
σ2

PK
k=2(1+cos2 θk−2 cos θk), where
θk is the angle from the nearest PA to the target on the k-
th waveguide, while the range variance σ2
τ is computed by
following [13]. The performance of the RSS-based method
will be compared with that of using TDoA. For angle-based
localization, estimating the AoA typically requires the use of
antenna arrays [8], while a single PA or a target equipped with
only a single antenna cannot extract angle information.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
A. Simulation Setups
For the simulation setup, waveguides are modeled using a
PLP with line density λl = 0.1/π m−1 in the 2-D disk with
center point at the origin and radius Ra = 30 m, while the pre-
defined locations on each waveguide are randomly distributed
according to a 1-D HPPP with density λs = 0.1 m−1. Each
PA transmits signals with a constant power of Pt = 1 W, and
the path-loss exponent is set to α = 2.1 [9]. All simulation
results are averaged over 105 independent runs.

localizability decreases as the required SINR increases. Al-
though a higher SINR value guarantees better RSS quality, it
is crucial to optimize network design to mitigate the impact
of interference on localization performance. As the number
of available waveguides increases, the overall localizability
deteriorates. It is understandable that when different PAs
transmit distinct pilots to the target for extracting RSS samples,
an increase in the number of PAs results in greater interference.
Figure 3 provides insights into how the number of available
waveguides K affects the overall localization performance. It
is evident that increasing the number of waveguides does not
always guarantee improved localization accuracy. When the
number of available waveguides is limited (e.g., K = 3 to 5),
the localization performance improves with K since the benefit
of additional measurements outweighs the effect of interfer-
ence. Notably, when K = 5, the RSS-based scheme achieves
the lowest mean-square error (MSE), indicating the best local-
ization performance. However, further increasing the number
of waveguides results in worse localization performance, as
interference becomes the dominant factor. Therefore, it is
essential to determine the optimal number of waveguides for
localization to balance the trade-off between interference and
localization accuracy.
C. Overall Localization Performance
Figure 4 examines the performance of the RSS-based local-
ization across different SINR values. The theoretical results
generated by Proposition 2 are consistent with the exact RSS-
based CRLB obtained from (11). Furthermore, we compare
PA system-assisted localization with conventional ULA-based
localization. By adjusting the PA locations, the LoS distance
between the PA and the target user is shortened, resulting in
the acquisition of higher-quality RSS samples. The PA system
also provides greater spatial diversity, whereas the ULA offers
location-related measurement observations from only a single
standpoint. Thus, the PA system systematically achieves better
localization performance than the ULA.
Figure 5 shows that the theoretical results generated by
(14) closely match the simulation results, verifying the the-


5
oretical development of the CRLB distribution. Compared
to the exact CRLB (11), the CRLB distribution provides
insights into the overall localization performance. For in-
stance, Fig. 5 shows that the RSS-based scheme achieves 3-
meter localization accuracy with a probability of 40%. We
also compare the RSS-based scheme with the TDoA-based
method [15]. Since RSS measurements are less stable in signal
propagation environments, while high-resolution TDoAs can
be leveraged for localization, the TDoA-based scheme in PA
systems outperforms that of using RSS. However, in practice,
obtaining accurate time measurements in a PA system without
the assistance of additional receivers, such as a ULA or LCC,
remains an open challenge. Thus, the RSS-based localization
scheme remains a favorable solution for PA systems.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented a unified analytical framework for
PA-assisted localization using stochastic geometry, modeling
waveguides via a PLP. Our framework enables network-level
performance analysis without intensive simulations and pro-
vides insights into selecting the optimal number of waveguides
to achieve the optimal localization performance in terms of
target localizability and CRLB. Numerical results showed that
the PA-assisted system outperforms fixed-antenna systems, un-
derscoring the benefits of using PAs for accurate positioning.
