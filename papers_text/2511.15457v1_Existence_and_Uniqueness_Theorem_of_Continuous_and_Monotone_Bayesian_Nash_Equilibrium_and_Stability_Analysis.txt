Abstract
Since the seminal work by Meirowitz [12], there has been growing attention on the exis-
tence and uniqueness of continuous Bayesian Nash equilibria. In the existing literature, ex-
istence is typically established using Schauder’s fixed-point theorem, relying on the equicon-
tinuity of players’ best response functions. Uniqueness, on the other hand, is usually derived
under additional monotonicity conditions. In this paper, we revisit the issues of existence
and uniqueness, and advance the literature by establishing both simultaneously using the
Banach fixed-point theorem under a set of moderate conditions. Furthermore, we analyze
the stability of such equilibria with respect to perturbations in the joint probability distri-
bution of type parameters, offering theoretical support for the application of Bayesian Nash
equilibrium models in data-driven contexts.

Introduction
In recent years, there has been a growing focus on Nash games involving private information. A
common assumption in such games is that the initial distribution of all players’ types is publicly
known. Each player has full knowledge of their own type, which determines their utility func-
tion, while remaining unaware of their opponents’ types. Based on the prior information, each
player selects a response strategy within their type space based on the Nash conjecture, and an
equilibrium arising from this kind of game is known as a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE). The
concept of the Bayesian game was introduced by Harsanyi [7, 8, 9] and has attracted consid-
erable attention, spanning from modeling to equilibrium analysis and applications in strategic
decision-making under incomplete information.

Existence of pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibria (BNEs) has been studied extensively
ever since. A majority of research on the existence of monotone BNE (MBNE) has focused
on conditions related to supermodularity and single-crossing condition (SCC). Vives [23] ana-
lyzes existence of Nash equilibria of non-cooperative games by using lattice theoretical methods,
where each player’s payoffs satisfy certain supermodularity properties which are directly related
to strategic complementarities. The author also establishes existence of BNE as the supermod-
ularity is preserved by integration.
Athey [2] studied Bayesian games with one-dimensional
actions and type spaces, assuming that types are drawn from an atomless joint probability dis-
tribution. When each player’s expected utility function exhibits SCC property, i.e., each player’s
optimal response is increasing with respect to the increase of its type parameter in response to
rivals’ increasing strategies (for type varying), she demonstrated existence of pure strategy Nash
equilibria (PSNEs) in every finite action game with each player’s optimal response strategy being
increasing and step-like. Moreover, when action spaces are continuous, Athey shows existence of
a sequence of increasing step-like PSNEs of finite action games that converges to an equilibrium
with the continuum-action, which means that an equilibrium in continuous action spaces can be
approximated by a sequence of increasing step-like PSNEs in finite action spaces. Mcadams [11]
extends Athey’s results into more general settings by considering the quasi-supermodularity (in
own action) and single-crossing (in own action and type), where both action and type spaces
are considered to be multidimensional and only partially ordered. Reny [15] further relaxes the
requirements on payoff functions, showing that monotone best-reply conditions can hold under
weaker assumptions. Van Zandt and Vives [22] introduce a concept called “monotone super-
modularity” in Bayesian games, where, apart from strategic complementarities, each player’s
payoff also has increasing differences in their own action and the profile of types, and that each
player’s posterior beliefs are increasing in type with respect to first-order stochastic dominance.
They provide an induction method to construct a greatest and a least BNE, with both equilibria
being monotone in type.
Another research stream focuses on the continuity property of BNEs. By using Schauder’s
fixed-point theorem under some moderate conditions, Meirowitz [12] establishes existence of
a continuous BNE (CBNE) with each player’s equilibrium strategy being continuous.
One
of the main conditions is the equicontinuity of the set of optimal response strategies, which
ensures that the operator mapping the set of optimal response strategies to itself is compact.
Meirowitz comments that the equicontinuity condition is either likely to fail or difficult to verify
in practical applications. Ui [21] provides a sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness of a
differentiable BNE by regarding it as a solution of a variational inequality problem. The author
demonstrates that when the Jacobian matrix of the payoff gradient is negative definite for each
state, a BNE is unique. Guo et al. [6] take a step forward by presenting some verifiable conditions
for the required equicontinuity, namely, some growth conditions of the expected utility function
of each player. Moreover, under some monotonicity conditions, the authors demonstrate the
uniqueness of a CBNE. The authors also develop some computational approaches for finding an
approximate CBNE by using the polynomial decision rule to restrict the strategy function.
More recently, there has been some research extending the BNE model to the generalized
Bayesian Nash equilibrium (GBNE) model, where the key difference between GBNE and BNE
is that, in GBNE, the action space depends on the type parameter or rivals’ actions due to
2


some constraints. Liu et al. [10] propose the price competition model under multinomial logit
demand where each firm’s marginal cost is private information, and each firm’s action space is
dependent on its marginal cost. Tao and Xu [18] consider a generalized Bayesian game where
each player’s action space depends on its own type parameter and the rivals’ actions. Under
some moderate conditions, they demonstrate existence of continuous GBNE and the uniqueness
of such an equilibrium when each player’s action space is only dependent on its type. In the case
that each player’s action space is also dependent on rivals’ actions, they give a simple example to
show that the uniqueness of GBNE is not guaranteed under standard monotone conditions. In a
further study, Su and Xu [17] introduce a Bayesian Nash risk equilibrium (BNRE) model, where
they considered the concepts of aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, discussing the
model from two perspectives: monotonicity of a continuous BNRE and continuity of a monotone
BNRE.
In this paper, we revisit the BNE problem with two new and substantial theoretical contri-
butions.
• We establish the Lipschitz continuity of each player’s optimal response function with re-
spect to both their own type parameter and the actions of their rivals, by leveraging the
classical implicit function theorem rather than relying on growth conditions under the
assumption that each player’s utility function is strongly monotone (Theorem 3.1). This
result enables us to simultaneously establish the existence and uniqueness of CBNE using
the Banach fixed-point theorem (Theorem 3.2).
• Under a set of moderate conditions, we quantify the stability and sensitivity of the CBNE
with respect to perturbations in the joint probability distribution of type parameters (The-
orems 4.1 and 4.2).
These new results address an important gap in the literature on
Bayesian Nash equilibria and provide theoretical foundations for applying BNE models
to data-driven problems, where the true distribution of type parameters is often only
approximately recovered from empirical data.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we introduce the Bayesian
game and define the continuous and monotone Bayesian Nash equilibrium (CMBNE) concept.
Section 3 presents our main existence and uniqueness results for CMBNE and discusses how
our conditions relate to the existing literature. In Section 4, we study the stability of CBNE
with respect to perturbations of the joint distribution of types. Finally, Section 5 concludes the
paper and outlines directions for future research.
Throughout the paper, we adopt the following notation. By convention, we use IRn to denote
n-dimensional Euclidean space, and we write ∥x∥and ∥x∥∞to denote the Euclidean norm and
the infinity norm of x ∈IRn respectively. We use P(Ξ) to denote the set of all probability mea-
sures over set Ξ in a finite dimensional space equipped with Borel sigma algebra. For any measur-
able function fi : Θi ⊂IRdi →Ai ⊂IRzi, we use ∥fi∥∞= maxθi∈Θi ∥fi(θi)∥to denote the infinity
norm. For 1 ≤p ≤∞, we define the Lp(ηi)-norm by ∥fi∥Lp(ηi) :=
R
Θi ∥fi(θi)∥p dηi(θi)
1/p
for
ηi ∈P(Θi). For function vectors f := (f1, . . . , fn) and g := (g1, . . . , gn), we use ∥f −g∥∞,Lp :=
max1≤i≤n ∥fi −gi∥Lp(ηi) to denote the composition of the infinity norm over a finite-dimensional
vector space and the Lp-norm of functions in each component of the vector.

The Model
We consider a Bayesian game with n players. Each player possesses a preference utility function
denoted by ui(ai, a−i, θ), for i ∈N := {1, · · · , n}, which depends on the player’s action ai, its
rival’s actions a−i := (a1, · · · , ai−1, ai+1, · · · , an), and the player i’s type θi. We assume that a
type θi takes values from set Θi and an action ai takes values from action space Ai, where Θi
and Ai are non-empty, compact and convex subsets of IRdi and IRzi respectively. Following the
terminology of Meirowitz [12], a profile of types is a vector θ := (θ1, · · · , θn) ∈Θ := Θ1×· · ·×Θn
and a profile of actions is a vector a := (a1, · · · , an) ∈A := A1 × · · · × An. Using the standard
notation, we denote by a−i and θ−i respectively the vector of actions and the types of all players
except i. Assume θi is a random variable with a probability distribution, denoted by ηi(θi),
for i ∈N. Conditional on its type θi, player i’s posterior belief about θ−i is represented by a
conditional probability distribution ηi(· | θi), which describes the probability of player i’s rivals
taking a particular type θ−i.
Information on players’ types is private which means each player only knows its own type
but not other’s. Following the standard set-up in Bayesian games, we assume the joint proba-
bility distribution of θ, denoted by η(θ), is public information with density function q(θ) defined
over Θ. This information describes the probability of all players taking a particular θ, which
may be retrieved from empirical data. Throughout the paper, we will use θ to denote a deter-
ministic element of IRd1+···+dn or a random vector θ(ω) : (Ω, B, η) →IRd1+···+dn depending on
the context. With η(θ) and ηi(θi), we can derive the conditional probability density function
qi (θ−i|θi) :=
q(θ−i,θi)
R
Θ−i q(θ−i,θi)dθ−i , which represents player i’s belief about the distribution of rivals’
type parameters θ−i.
In Bayesian games with pure strategy, the response (strategy) function of player i is repre-
sented by fi mapping from type space Θi to action space Ai. For i ∈N, we denote by Fi the set
of measurable functions fi : Θi →Ai endowed with the infinity norm ∥fi∥∞= maxθi∈Θi ∥fi(θi)∥,
and Ci ⊂Fi the set of continuous functions, where ∥· ∥denotes the Euclidean norm. Moreover,
we use F+
i ⊂Fi and C+
i ⊂Ci to denote the sets of increasing functions and increasing continuous
functions respectively. For the simplicity of notation, we write
F (res. F+) :=
Y
i∈N
Fi (res. F+),
F−i (res. F+
−i) :=
Y
i∈N\{i}
Fi (res. F+
i ),
(2.1a)
C (res. C+) :=
Y
i∈N
Ci (res. C+
i ),
C−i (res. C+
−i), :=
Y
i∈N\{i}
Ci (res. C+
i ).
(2.1b)
We define each player’s expected utility function given the rivals’ strategy function f−i by
ϑi(ai, f−i, θi) :=
Z
Θ−i
ui(ai, f−i(θ−i), θi, θ−i)dηi (θ−i|θi) , ∀θi ∈Θi,
(2.2)
where the expectation is taken with respect to the conditional probability distribution ηi (θ−i|θi),
and f−i(θ−i) represents the rivals’ action at scenario θ−i ∈Θ−i := Θ1×· · ·×Θi−1×Θi+1×· · ·×Θn.
Assuming each player sets its optimal strategy based on their maximal expected utility function
(2.2) under the Nash conjecture, which means each player identifies its optimal response function
4


by holding rivals’ optimal response functions f−i as fixed, we consider the definition of Bayesian
Nash equilibrium (BNE) arising from it as follows.
Definition 2.1 (Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE)) A pure strategy Bayesian Nash equi-
librium is an n-tuple of functions f∗:= (f∗
1 , · · · , f∗
n) ∈F mapping from Θ1 × · · · × Θn to
A1 × · · · × An such that

i (θi) ∈arg max
ai∈Ai
Z
Θ−i
ui(ai, f∗
−i(θ−i), θi, θ−i)dηi(θ−i|θi), ∀θi ∈Θi,
(2.3)
for i ∈N. f∗is said to be a continuous and monotone BNE (CMBNE) if f∗
i is continuous and
monotone over Θi for i ∈N.
Based on (2.2), we can write the BNE model (2.3) succinctly as
f∗
i (θi) ∈arg max
ai∈Ai
ϑi(ai, f∗
−i, θi), ∀θi ∈Θi,
(2.4)
for i ∈N. Model (2.4) can be interpreted purely from Nash equilibrium perspective, where each
player’s optimal action is assumed to be a function of player’s type parameter, rather than a
fixed action in a Nash game. This is an infinite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem where
each player’s optimal action is a function.

Existence and uniqueness
In this section, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of a CMBNE. In the literature of
Bayesian games, there are two primary approaches to establishing the existence of a BNE, de-
pending on the structure of the objective functions. One is based on Schauder’s fixed-point theo-
rem, see e.g. [6, 12, 18], where the BNEs are continuous with respect to type varying. The other
is based on the fixed-point theorems associated with single-crossing and quasi-supermodularity
properties, see e.g. [2, 11, 15, 22, 23], where the BNEs are not necessarily continuous but mono-
tone under some moderate conditions. Su and Xu [17] examined the existence of BNRE models
from two perspectives: the monotonicity of a continuous BNRE and the continuity of a mono-
tone BNRE, thereby unifying two strands of existing research. In this section, we revisit this
issue by presenting a novel approach for establishing existence and uniqueness. Specifically, we
focus on the case where each player’s objective function is strongly monotone in its action and
uniformly so with respect to other parameters.
3.1
Lipschitz continuity of the optimal response function
We begin by deriving Lipschitz continuity of the optimal response function with respect to the
type parameter and the rival’s actions. To this end, we make the following assumption.
Assumption 3.1 Consider the BNE model (2.3).
For i ∈N, (a) ui(a, θ) is continuously
differentiable in (a, θ); (b) for each f−i ∈F−i and θi ∈Θi, for every ˆai ∈Ai, there exists a
5


closed neighborhood Ui(ˆai) ⊆Ai and an ηi(· | θi)-integrable function hˆai : Θ−i × Θi →IR+, with
hˆai(·, θi) ∈L1 ηi(· | θi)

, such that
sup
ai∈Ui(ˆai)
∇aiui(ai, f−i(θ−i), θi, θ−i)
 ≤hˆai(θ−i, θi),
∀θ−i ∈Θ−i.
(3.1)
Under Assumption 3.1, for each fixed f−i ∈F−i and θi ∈Θi, ϑi(ai, f−i, θi) is continuously
differentiable on Ai and
∇aiϑi(ai, f−i, θi) =
Z
Θ−i
∇aiui(ai, f−i(θ−i), θi, θ−i)dηi(θ−i|θi).
(3.2)
The conclusion can be easily established by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem. A
stronger but often easier-to-verify condition that implies the same conclusion is the global Lip-
schitz in ai, i.e., there exists hi : Θ−i × Θi →IR+ with hi(·, θi) ∈L1 ηi(· | θi)

such that, for all
a′
i, a′′
i ∈Ai and all θ−i ∈Θ−i,
ui(a′
i, f−i(θ−i), θi, θ−i) −ui(a′′
i , f−i(θ−i), θi, θ−i)
 ≤hi(θ−i, θi)∥a′
i −a′′
i ∥.
(3.3)
Together with Assumption 3.1 (a), this implies ∥∇aiui(ai, f−i(θ−i), θi, θ−i)∥≤hi(θ−i, θi) for all
ai ∈Ai, so Assumption 3.1 (b) holds with hˆai ≡hi. In the forthcoming discussions, we use
Assumption 3.1.
Proposition 3.1 Consider the BNE model (2.3). Suppose Assumption 3.1 holds, and for i ∈N,
(a) for each θ−i ∈Θ−i, there exists a nonnegative integrable function νi(θ−i) such that for each
a ∈A and θ′
i, θ′′
i ∈Θi,
∥∇aiui(a, θ′
i, θ−i) −∇aiui(a, θ′′
i , θ−i)∥≤νi(θ−i)∥θ′
i −θ′′
i ∥;
(b) the density function qi(·|θi) of the conditional distribution ηi(· | θi) is Lipschitz continuous
over Θi with modulus γi, that is,
|qi(θ−i|θ′
i) −qi(θ−i|θ′′
i )| ≤γi∥θ′
i −θ′′
i ∥, ∀θ′
i, θ′′
i ∈Θi.
Then ∇aiϑi(ai, f−i, θi) is Lipschitz continuous over Θi for all ai and f−i with modulus κi, that
is
∥∇aiϑi(ai, f−i, θ′
i) −∇aiϑi(ai, f−i, θ′′

which implies the Lipschitz continuity of ∇aiϑi(ai, f−i, θi) in θi with modulus κi.
□
Proposition 3.1 postulates that the marginal expected utility ∇aiϑi(ai, f−i, θi) is Lipschitz in
the type θi (modulus κi), providing stability in the own–type dimension and thereby bounding
how the player’s marginal expected utility varies with θi. To obtain a global Lipschitz estimate
for the player’s optimal response function, we further make the following assumption.
Assumption 3.2 Consider the BNE model (2.3).
For i ∈N, assume: (a) ui(ai, a−i, θ) is
strongly concave over Ai for all a−i and θ with constant σi, i.e.,

(b) ∇aiui(ai, a−i, θ) is Lipschitz continuous in ai over A−i uniformly for all ai and θ with moduli

j̸=i
τij∥a′
j −a′′
j ∥, ∀a′
−i, a′′
−i ∈A−i.
(3.6)
The strong concavity of ui in ai ensures that player i’s optimal response function is single-valued.
The constant σi in inequality (3.5) represents the minimal curvature of the utility function, which
signifies the ratio of the marginal utility w.r.t. player i’s change of action.
Assumption 3.2
(b) imposes a blockwise Lipschitz bound on the marginal utility ∇aiui with moduli {τij}j̸=i,
controlling the cross–effect of rivals’ actions on player i’s marginal utility. Together with (a),
this linear control yields a global (blockwise) Lipschitz estimate for player i’s optimal response
with respect to rivals’ strategies f−i.
Theorem 3.1 (Lipschitz continuity of the optimal response function) Consider the BNE
model (2.3). Suppose that Assumptions 3.1 - 3.2 and all the conditions in Proposition 3.1 are
satisfied. Then the optimal response function A∗
i (f−i, θi) is Lipschitz continuous in θi with mod-
ulus κi
σi , and is blockwise Lipschitz continuous in f−i with moduli {τij

Before providing a proof, it might be helpful to make some comments on the conditions
and the conclusions of this theorem. The main condition that we impose is the uniform strong
concavity condition of ui(ai, a−i, θ) in ai. Guo et al. [6] use the condition to derive equicontinuity
of the optimal response function. Since their derivation is based on the second-order growth
condition, the optimal response function is shown to be 1
2-H¨older continuous in θi. Here, we use
the same condition to derive a stronger result in equality (3.7), that is, Lipschitz continuity of
the response function in both θi, and under some additional conditions, the Lipschitz continuity
in f−i (inequality (3.8)). The Lipschitz continuity may be viewed as stability of each player’s
optimal response functions against w.r.t. variation of its own type parameter and the rivals’
optimal response functions. The new result will allow us to derive existence and uniqueness of a
continuous BNE in one go and a completely different manner from Guo et al. [6]. Moreover, the
Lipschitz continuity also enables us to derive quantitative sensitivity robustness of the continuous
BNE.
Proof. We use Lemma A.1 to prove the results. Under Assumptions 3.1 - 3.2 and the conditions
in Proposition 3.1, we assert that ∇aiϑi (ai, f−i, θi) is strongly monotone in ai uniformly with
respect to f−i, θi. By fixing up f−i and treating θi as a varying parameter, we obtain

This implies that A∗
i (f−i, ·) is blockwise Lipschitz continuous in f−i.
□
In Theorem 3.1 we consider the Lp(ηi) norm, where by taking p = ∞it recovers the uniform
(max) norm.
Compared with the uniform (max) norm ∥· ∥∞driven by the most adverse
type, which can be overly conservative (and discontinuity–sensitive), the Lp(ηi) norm averages
typewise deviations with respect to the player’s own-type marginal ηi(θi).
We are now ready to state the main result of this section, that is, existence and uniqueness
of CBNE.
Theorem 3.2 (Existence and uniqueness of CBNE) Consider problem (2.3). Assume that
all the conditions in Theorem 3.1 are satisfied. Then the following assertions hold.
(i) The problem has a CBNE with all players’ optimal response functions being uniformly
Lipschitz continuous at the equilibrium.
(ii) If, in addition, P
j̸=i τij < σi for i ∈N, then there exists a unique CBNE.
Proof. Let F be defined as in (2.1a) and f ∈F. Define the mapping
Ψ(f) :=

( ˜f1, . . . , ˜fn) ∈F : ˜fi(θi) ∈arg max
ai∈Ai
ϑi(ai, f−i, θi), ∀θi ∈Θi, i ∈N

.
(3.12)
Part (i). This result is established in Guo et al. [6] where the equicontinuity of each player’s
response function is shown to be 1
2-H¨older continuous (when the order of growth is 2). Here
we use the Lipschitz continuity of the response functions as stated in (3.7). Let C be defined
as in (2.1b). We verify that Ψ : C →C is a compact operator. By Theorem 3.1, A∗
i (f−i, θi) is
equicontinuous over Θi. Since S
θi∈Θi A∗
i (f−i, θi) ⊂Ai is uniformly bounded, then by Lemma
A.4, Ψ(C) is relatively compact. Moreover, it follows by Theorem 3.1 that A∗
i (f−i, ·) : C−i →Ci
is continuous in f−i for i ∈N. This shows that Ψ : C →C is a continuous operator. By Lemma
A.3, problem (2.3) has a CBNE. Let f∗be a CBNE. For any θ′, θ′′ ∈Θ,

(3.14)
By Banach’s fixed-point theorem [24, Chapter 3], a unique CBNE exists.
□
Theorem 3.2 (ii) is entirely new. It establishes existence and uniqueness of a CBNE under a
unified condition P
j̸=i τij < σi, which is a departure from [6, 17, 18, 21]. The condition means
that the minimal effect on each player’s marginal utility caused by the change of its own action
(measured by σi) must dominate the aggregate external influence caused by rivals’ strategies
(measured by P
j̸=i τij).
From the proofs of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 (ii), we know that the contraction property of Ψ does
not rely on the Lipschitz continuity of ∇aiϑi(ai, f−i, θi) and A∗(f−i, θi) w.r.t. θi. Hence, even
if the optimal responses are not continuous in types, we may work in Lp space, interpret each
player’s strategy as a measurable function defined ηi–a.e., and still apply Banach’s fixed–point
theorem to obtain existence and uniqueness of a (not necessarily continuous) Bayesian Nash
equilibrium. The following corollary summarizes this.
Corollary 3.1 (Existence and uniqueness of BNE) Consider the BNE model (2.3). Sup-
pose that Assumptions 3.1 - 3.2 are satisfied, and for i ∈N, if P
j̸=i τij < σi holds. Then there
exists a unique BNE.
This result is straightforward, and hence we do not give the proof here.
The following
symmetric three-player Bayesian Cournot example illustrates that this dominance condition
P
j̸=i τij < σi can naturally hold in practice.
10


Example 3.1 (Symmetric three-player Bayesian Cournot game) Consider a symmetric
Bayesian Cournot game with three players. For each player i = 1, 2, 3, let
ui(ai, a−i, θ) = ai p(a1, a2, a3) −ci(ai, θi),
where p(a1, a2, a3) = α−β(a1+a2+a3), α, β > 0, is the inverse demand function and ci(ai, θi) =
θiai + c
2a2
i , c > 0, is the cost function.
The action and type spaces are Ai = [0, a], Θi =
[θ, θ], i = 1, 2, 3, and the type profile θ = (θ1, θ2, θ3) is drawn from a distribution η supported on
Θ1 × Θ2 × Θ3. Assume the density function qi(θ−i|θi) of the conditional distribution ηi(θ−i|θi)
is Lipschitz continuous in θi with modulus γi > 0. Then the utility function of player i takes the
form
ui(ai, a−i, θ) = (α −θi)ai −

∇2

which gives a strong concavity modulus σi = 2β + c. Furthermore, the gradient

Since τij = β and σi = 2β + c, the inequality P

guarantees that the optimal response mapping is a contraction mapping. Therefore, the Bayesian
Cournot game admits a unique equilibrium in which all players’ strategy functions are uniformly
Lipschitz continuous.
3.2
Monotonicity of the optimal response function
In Section 3.1, we discuss the case where each player’s optimal response function is Lipschitz
continuous with respect to variations of their types and rivals’ actions. In some practical applica-
tions, the optimal response function A∗
i (f−i, θi) may display some monotonicity w.r.t. variation
11


type parameter θi and the rivals’ actions.
For example, in Bertrand competition, a higher
marginal cost (type) pushes up the optimal price (action), and rivals’ higher prices also raise a
firm’s optimal response price (strategic complements), see [1, 23]. This kind of research is in
alignment with the literature of monotone comparative statics, see e.g., [3, 13, 20], which uses
order-theoretic tools such as quasi-supermodularity and single-crossing property to characterize
how optimal decisions react to changes in parameters. We briefly recall some relevant notions.
A partially ordered set (poset) is a pair (S, ≥), where ≥is a reflexive, transitive, and anti-
symmetric binary relation on S. For x, y ∈S, we write x > y if x ≥y and x ̸= y. A poset (S, ≥)
is (totally) ordered if for any x, y ∈S, either x ≥y or y ≥x. Given a non-empty subset L ⊂S,
an element u ∈S is an upper bound of L if u ≥a for all a ∈L. If there is an upper bound
u∗of L such that u∗≤u for every upper bound u of L, then u∗is the least upper bound (or
supremum) of L, denoted ∨L. The greatest lower bound (or infimum) ∧L is defined analogously.
A poset (S, ≥) is a lattice if any two elements x, y ∈S have a least upper bound x ∨
y := ∨{x, y} and a greatest lower bound x ∧y := ∧{x, y} in S.
A lattice is complete if
every non-empty subset L ⊂S has a supremum ∨L and an infimum ∧L in S. For example,
S = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)} ⊂IR2 is not a lattice, since (0, 1) and (1, 0) have no joint upper bound
in S. A subset L of the lattice S is a sublattice of S if the supremum and infimum of any two
elements of L also belong to L.
Given a lattice (S, ≥, ∨, ∧) and an index set Θ, a function f : S × Θ →IR is quasi-
supermodular in x if
f(x′, θ) ≥(>)f(x′ ∧x, θ) ⇒f(x′ ∨x, θ) ≥(>)f(x, θ)
for all x′, x ∈S and all θ ∈Θ. The function f is supermodular in x if
f(x′ ∨x, θ) + f(x′ ∧x, θ) ≥f(x′, θ) + f(x, θ), ∀x′, x ∈S, θ ∈Θ.
If f is positive, it is log-supermodular in x if
f(x′ ∨x, θ) × f(x′ ∧x, θ) ≥f(x′, θ) × f(x, θ), ∀x′, x ∈S, θ ∈Θ.
Both properties are stronger than quasi-supermodularity. In the case that S = IRm and f is
twice-continuously differentiable in x, then f is supermodular if and only if ∂2f(x,θ)
∂xi ∂xj ≥0 for all
x ∈S, θ ∈Θ and i ̸= j, see [19, Theorems 3.1 and 3.2].
Given a parameter poset (T, ≥), a function g : S×T ×Θ →IR is said to satisfy single-crossing
property in (x, t) if
g(x′, t, θ) ≥(>)g(x, t, θ) ⇒g(x′, t′, θ) ≥(>)g(x, t′, θ)
for all x′ > x ∈S, all t′ > t ∈T, and all θ ∈Θ. A sufficient condition of the single-crossing
property is increasing differences in (x, t), that is, g(x′, t, θ) −g(x, t, θ) is increasing in t for
x′ > x, or equivalently, if g(x, t′, θ) −g(x, t, θ) is increasing in x for t′ > t. Supermodularity is
a stronger property than increasing differences: if T is also a lattice and if g is supermodular
over X × T, then g has increasing differences in (x, t). In addition, if the positive function g is
log-supermodular over X × T, it also satisfies the weak single-crossing property in (x, t).
12


Reny [15] further introduces the concepts of weakly quasi-supermodular and weak single-
crossing, where both of them release the requirements for strict inequalities, playing important
roles in the following discussion.
Assumption 3.3 For each player i ∈N, the action space Ai is a sublattice of IRzi.
In Section 2, we only assume that Ai ⊂IRzi is compact and convex, which does not en-
sure the lattice property under the coordinatewise (natural) order.
For instance, let Ai :=

(a, b) ∈IR2 : a2 + b2 ≤1
	
. Then Ai is compact and convex, but it is not a sublattice of IR2:
with x = (1, 0) and y = (0, 1) in Ai, the coordinatewise join is x ∨y = (1, 1) /∈Ai. Thus, we
cannot start monotone iterations from a bottom/top action, nor guarantee that the pointwise
infimum/supremum of monotone sequences of actions remain in Ai.
By Topkis [20, Theorem 2.3.1], a sublattice of IRzi is subcomplete if and only if it is compact.
Hence any non-empty compact sublattice is a complete lattice under the coordinatewise order.
A simple and widely used instance is the closed interval in IRzi, that is,
Ai :=

ai = (ai1, . . . , aizi) ∈IRzi  aij ≤aij ≤aij, for j = 1, · · · , zi
	
,
Assumption 3.3 strengthens the structure to a complete lattice precisely to guarantee the pres-
ence of extremal elements (so that we can initialize from ∧Ai or ∨Ai) and the closure of Ai under
arbitrary supremum and infimum. These properties are crucial for constructing extremal equi-
libria via monotone optimal–response iterations and for carrying out lattice–theoretic monotone
comparative statics.
Proposition 3.2 (Monotonicity of the optimal response) Consider the BNE model (2.3).
Suppose Assumption 3.3 and all the conditions in Theorem 3.1 are satisfied, and for i ∈N,
ϑi(ai, f−i, θi) is weakly quasi-supermodular in ai ∈Ai for all f−i ∈F+
−i and θi ∈Θi. Then the
following assertions hold.
(i) For each fixed θi ∈Θi, if ϑi(ai, f−i, θi) is weak single-crossing over Ai × F−i, then the
optimal response function A∗
i (f−i, θi) is Lipschitz continuous and increasing in f−i ∈F−i.
(ii) For each fixed f−i ∈F+
−i, if ϑi(ai, f−i, θi) is weak single-crossing over Ai × Θi, then the
optimal response function A∗
i (f−i, θi) is Lipschitz continuous and increasing in θi ∈Θi.
By virtue of monotone comparative statics results as shown in Su and Xu [17, Proposi-
tion 3.2], the above assertions follow directly, thus we omit the proof here. Sufficient condi-
tions for quasi-supermodularity and single-crossing in Bayesian games are well-documented such
as supermodularity and increasing differences (see e.g., [2, 22]) , and the log-supermodularity
(e.g., [2, 3, 14]). Specifically, if Ai ⊂IR, then the supermodularity is automatically satisfied, due
to the fact that IR is totally ordered and hence (a′
i ∨ai), (a′
i ∧ai) ∈{a′
i, ai} for all a′
i, ai ∈Ai.
Theorem 3.3 (Existence and uniqueness of greatest and least CMBNEs) Consider the
BNE model (2.3). Suppose: (a) Assumption 3.3 and all the conditions in Theorem 3.1 hold; (b)
ϑi(ai, f−i, θi) is weak single-crossing over Ai ×F+
−i for all θi ∈Θi. Then the following assertions
hold.
13


(i) The problem has a greatest BNE and a least BNE, with all players’ equilibrium strategy
functions being uniformly Lipschitz continuous.
(ii) If, in addition, ϑi(ai, f−i, θi) satisfies weak single-crossing over Ai × Θi for all f−i ∈F+
−i
and θi ∈Θi, then the greatest and the least CBNEs are monotone.
(iii) Furthermore, if P
j̸=i τij < σi for all i ∈N, then the greatest and least CMBNEs coincide,
hence the equilibrium is unique.
Proof. Part (i). We only show existence of the greatest BNE as existence of the least BNE
can be proved analogously. By Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 3.2 (i), A∗
i (f−i, θi) is Lipschitz
continuous over F−i × Θi, and the functional mapping A∗
i (f−i, ·) : F−i →Ci is increasing with
respect to f−i ∈F−i. Let Ψ(f) be defined as in (3.12), and hence we can conclude from the
discussions above that the operator Ψ(·) is increasing in f.
Next, we show existence of the greatest CBNE. For each i, let f0
i (θi) := ∨Ai for all θi ∈Θi,
i.e., the constant function at the top element of Ai. Let f0 := (f0
1 , . . . , f0
n) ∈F. Let f0 :=
(f0
1 , . . . , f0
n) ∈F+, and define the sequence of functions
fk := Ψ(fk−1),
for k ∈N+.
Since f0 is the profile of the greatest response functions, it follows that f1 ≤f0. Together
with the increasing property of operator Ψ(·), we can deduce that f2 = Ψ(f1) ≤Ψ(f0) = f1.
By induction, it follows that the sequence of optimal response functions {fk}k∈N is decreasing.
This implies that {fk
i (θi)} is a decreasing sequence for all θi ∈Θi, i ∈N. Since the sequence is
lower bounded by ∧Ai, then every decreasing sequence in Ai converges to its infimum, denoted
by f∞
i (θi). Thus, we can conclude that fk
i converges pointwise to f∞
i . Since Θ is compact
and {fk}k∈N is a decreasing sequence of continuous functions, Dini’s theorem implies that fk
converges to f∞uniformly. Moreover, by Theorem 3.1 each fk is uniformly Lipschitz with a
common modulus independent of k, so f∞is also Lipschitz continuous.
Finally, we show that the limit f∞must be the greatest equilibrium. To see this, let ˜f ̸= f∞
be a BNE. Then ˜f ≤f0. By applying the operator Ψ(·) on both sides of the inequality and
using the fact that Ψ( ˜f) = ˜f, we arrive at fk ≥˜f for all k ∈N. By driving k to ∞, we obtain
f∞≥˜f.
Part (ii). By Proposition 3.2 (ii) guarantee that for each f−i ∈F+
−i, the optimal response
A∗
i (f−i, θi) is Lipschitz continuous and increasing over Θi, which means that A∗
i (f−i, ·) ∈C+
i .
Therefore, the operator Ψ : C+ →C+.
Since f0 = (∨A1, . . . , ∨An) ∈C+, it implies that
f1 = Ψ(f0) ∈C+.
As the same induction scheme of Part (i), we can derive the greatest
Lipschitz continuous equilibrium f∞. For all θ ≥θ′ ∈Θ and k ∈N, we have fk(θ) ≥fk(θ′),
then it follows that f∞(θ) = limk→∞fk(θ) ≥limk→∞fk(θ′) = f∞(θ′). Therefore, the greatest
equilibrium f∞is increasing over Θ.
Part (iii). When P
j̸=i τij < σi for all i, Theorem 3.2 (ii) shows that the optimal response
operator Ψ is a contraction on F (under the ∥· ∥∞,Lp norm), hence the CBNE is unique. In
particular, the greatest and least CMBNEs constructed in Parts (i)–(ii) must coincide with this
unique equilibrium.

Stability of CBNE
In this section, we investigate the stability of continuous Bayesian Nash equilibrium against
the perturbation of µ, the joint distribution of θ. The main motivation which underlies this
part of research is that in data-driven problems, the true probability distribution η may be
unknown and has to be recovered from empirical data. Moreover, the empirical data may be
potentially contaminated. This raises a question as to how to obtain an approximate CBNE
based on empirical data and whether such an approximate equilibrium is stable against the data
perturbation.
Let P(Θ) denote the set of all probability distributions over Θ and let η ∈P(Θ) be the
true probability distribution of θ as discussed in Section 3. For µ ∈P(Θ), denote
λ(θ) := dµ
dη (θ),
λi(θi) := dµi
dηi
(θi),
whenever the Radon-Nikodym derivatives exist. We define the admissible class of perturbation
distributions as

(4.1)
Since µ ∼η, each marginal µi is equivalent to ηi, so λi = dµi/dηi is well-defined and strictly
positive ηi-a.e. on Θi. Then, for each i ∈N, the conditional distributions satisfy
dµ(θ−i|θi) = λ(θ)
λi(θi) dηi(θ−i|θi).
By Assumption 3.1, for each ˆai ∈Ai there exist a neighborhood Ui(ˆai) and an integrable function

Assuming that A∗

i,η(f−i, θi) are singleton, we quantify the difference between the
corresponding CBNEs in terms of the Kantorovich distance between the probability distributions
ηi(· | θi) and µi(· | θi) for i ∈N. We need the following technical assumption.
Assumption 4.1 Consider the BNE model (2.3). For i ∈N, ∇aiui(ai, a−i, θi, θ−i) is Lipschitz
continuous in θ−i uniformly with respect to a and θi with constant modulus ϱi, i.e.,

(4.5)
The condition requires each player’s marginal utility function to be Lipschitz continuous

of rivals don’t directly affect a player’s utility function or its marginal in practice.

We are now ready to quantify the difference between the CBNEs f∗
η and f∗
µ.
We need the
mapping Ψ defined in (3.12). Note that since the function ϑi defined in (2.2) depends on the
underlying distribution η, then Ψ also depends on the distribution. Thus we write Ψµ and Ψη
respectively when the joint distribution of θ is perturbed from η to µ.

above gives rise to (4.6)
□
Inequality (4.6) provides a bound on the difference between the CBNEs before and after
perturbation of the probability distribution of θ under the infinity norm. When the range of the
support set Θ is large, the error bound may be large. This raises a question as to whether we can
quantify the difference by Lp-norm. To address the question, we need an additional condition
on the marginal distributions of the type parameters.
17


Assumption 4.2 (Equal own-type marginals) Let µ ∈M(Θ). We assume that, for each
player i ∈N, the marginal distribution of the own type θi under µ coincides with η, that is,
ηi(θi) = µi(θi)
for all θi ∈Θi.
(4.10)
Assumption 4.2 ensures that the joint distributions η and µ share the same marginal, which
means that a player’s belief about its own type is not affected by the perturbation, while its
beliefs about the opponents’ types and the dependence structure between θi and θ−i may change.
Thus, the optimal response gap ∆i(f−i, θi) := A∗
i,η(f−i, θi) −A∗
i,µ(f−i, θi) can be measured in
the Lp(ηi) for each fixed f−i ∈F−i,

When p = 1, the expectation on the right-hand side coincides with the conditional Wasserstein-

Unfortunately, we cannot use inequality (4.12) as we want to estimate dlK

terms of dlK(η, µ) in (4.6). This motivates use to adopt the relationship between kantorovich met-
ric and KL-divergence semi-distance bridged by the total variation metric when Θ is bounded,
as established in [5].

Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we explore a new way to derive existence and uniqueness of continuous Bayesian
Nash equilibrium and we have managed to do so by deriving Lipschitz continuity of each player’s
optimal response function w.r.t. variation of its type parameter and the rivals’ optimal response
functions uniformly w.r.t. other parameters. We derive a contraction condition, we enables us to
derive the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium by virtue of Banach fixed-point theorem
which significantly simply the proofs in the literature [6, 21]. We also make the first attempt to
quantify impact of perturbation of the joint probability distribution of type parameters on the
CBNE by deriving an explicit error bound. The new results will have potential effect on deriving
new computational methods for solving an approximate CBNE. It remains an open question as
to whether similar results can be established where the space of type parameters is unbounded.

Appendix
A.1
Stability of strongly monotone parametric variational inequality
The proofs of some technical results in the main body of the paper are essentially concerned
with the existence and Lipschitz continuity of the solution to a parametric variational inequality
where the underlying function is strongly monotone and Lipschitz continuous. Since the results
are of broader interest, we present them in a general form in this appendix.
Lemma A.1 Let X ⊂IRm be a non-empty, compact, and convex set and Y be a Polish space.
Let Φ : X × Y →IRm be a continuous mapping which is σ-strongly monotone in x uniformly
w.r.t. y. Then, for every y ∈Y, the generalized equation
0 ∈Φ(x, y) + NX (x)
admits a unique solution x∗(y) ∈X. Moreover,
∥x∗(y1) −x∗(y2)∥≤1
σ∥Φ(x∗(y2), y1) −Φ(x∗(y2), y2)∥, ∀y1, y2 ∈Y,
(A.1)
where
0 ∈Φ(x∗(y1), y1) + NX (x∗(y1)), 0 ∈Φ(x∗(y2), y2) + NX (x∗(y2)).
(A.2)
Proof. Existence. Fix y and write F(·) := Φ(·, y). For any τ > 0, define
T(x) := ΠX
 x −τF(x)

,
x ∈X,
where ΠX is the Euclidean projection onto X. Since F is continuous on compact X and ΠX is
continuous, T : X →X is continuous. By Brouwer’s fixed-point theorem there exists x∗∈X
with x∗= T(x∗), i.e.,
x∗= ΠX
 x∗−τF(x∗)

.
By the projection optimality condition, this is equivalent to
⟨F(x∗), x −x∗⟩≥0,
∀x ∈X,
i.e., 0 ∈F(x∗) + NX (x∗), so a solution exists.
Uniqueness. Let x1, x2 both satisfy 0 ∈Φ(x, y) + NX (x). Then
⟨Φ(x1, y), x2 −x1⟩≥0, ⟨Φ(x2, y), x1 −x2⟩≥0.
Using the strong monotonicity condition,
0 ≤⟨Φ(x1, y) −Φ(x2, y), x2 −x1⟩= −⟨Φ(x1, y) −Φ(x2, y), x1 −x2⟩≤−σ∥x1 −x2∥2,
hence x1 = x2.
23


Lipschitz continuity . By Lemma A.2, for each y the operator x 7→Φ(x, y) + NX (x) is σ-
strongly monotone in x uniformly w.r.t. y. For each y1, y2 ∈Y, by the strong monotonicity of
Φ(x, y1) + NX (x) in x, let v2 ∈Φ(x∗(y2), y1) + NX (x∗(y2)), we have
σ∥x∗(y1) −x∗(y2)∥2 ≤⟨x∗(y1) −x∗(y2), 0 −v2⟩,
(A.3)
which implies
σ∥x∗(y1) −x∗(y2)∥≤∥v2∥.
(A.4)
On the other hand, we know from (A.2) that
−Φ(x∗(y2), y2) ∈NX (x∗(y2)).
Therefore, we can set
v2 := Φ(x∗(y2), y1) −Φ(x∗(y2), y2)
(A.5)
in (A.3). A combination of (A.4) and (A.5) gives rise to (A.1).
□
The next lemma establishes the equivalence between strong monotonicity of a mapping
(vector-valued function) and strong monotonicity of its addition to a normal cone mapping.
Lemma A.2 Let X ⊂IRm be a non-empty, closed, and convex set and let Φ : X →IRm be a
mapping. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) Φ is σ-strongly monotone on X, i.e.,
⟨Φ(x1) −Φ(x2), x1 −x2⟩≥σ∥x1 −x2∥2, ∀x1, x2 ∈X.
(ii) The set-valued mapping x 7→Φ(x) + NX (x) is σ-strongly monotone on X, i.e.,

v1 −v2, x1 −x2

≥σ∥x1 −x2∥2,
∀x1, x2 ∈X, ∀vi ∈Φ(xi) + NX (xi),
where
NX (x) :=
n
w ∈IRm : ⟨w, x′ −x⟩≤0, ∀x′ ∈X
o
is the normal cone to X at x.
Proof. The result is perhaps well-known. We include it for self-containedness.
(i) =⇒(ii). We show that the mapping x 7→Φ(x) + NX (x) is strongly monotone in x. By
definition, the σ-strong monotonicity of Φ implies that
⟨Φ(x1) −Φ(x2), x1 −x2⟩≥σ∥x1 −x2∥2, ∀x1, x2 ∈X.
(A.6)
For any w1 ∈NX (x1), w2 ∈NX (x2), from the definition of the normal cone, we have
⟨w1, x2 −x1⟩≤0, ⟨w2, x1 −x2⟩≤0.
By adding them together, it follows that
⟨w1 −w2, x1 −x2⟩≥0.
(A.7)

Combining (A.6) and (A.7), we have
⟨(Φ(x1) + w1) −(Φ(x2) + w2), x1 −x2⟩≥σ∥x1 −x2∥2,
which shows that the mapping Φ(x) + NX (x) is σ-strongly monotone over X.
(ii) =⇒(i). Since the set-valued mapping Φ(x) + NX (x) is σ-strongly monotone on X, then

v1 −v2, x1 −x2

≥σ∥x1 −x2∥2, ∀x1, x2 ∈X, ∀vi ∈Φ(xi) + NX (xi).
Since 0 ∈NX (xi), we take vi = Φ(xi), then it follows that

Φ(x1) −Φ(x2), x1 −x2

≥σ∥x1 −x2∥2, ∀x1, x2 ∈X,
which shows that Φ(x) is σ-strongly monotone on X.

A.2
Schauder’s fixed point theorem and Arzel´a-Ascoli theorem
Let Z be a Banach space and T : Z →Z be an operator. A set in Z is called relatively compact
if its closure is compact. The operator T is said to be compact if it is continuous and maps
bounded sets into relatively compact sets.
Lemma A.3 (Schauder’s fixed-point theorem [24, Chapter 3]) If Z is a non-empty, closed,
bounded, convex subset of a Banach space Z and T : Z →Z is a compact operator, then T has
a fixed-point.
It is well-known that the relative compactness may be characterized by the uniform bound-
edness and equicontinuity. The next lemma states this.
Lemma A.4 (Arzel`a–Ascoli theorem [16, Theorem A5]) A set Z ⊂Z is relatively com-
pact if and only if Z satisfies the following two conditions: (a) uniform boundedness, i.e.,
supf∈Z ∥f∥∞< ∞, and (b) equicontinuity, i.e., for every ϵ > 0, there exists a constant δ > 0
such that supf∈Z ∥f(θ) −f(θ′)∥< ϵ, ∀θ, θ′ with ∥θ −θ′∥< δ.
