Abstract—Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large
Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative
Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various appli-
cations like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still
remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective
flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained,
and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously;
(2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also
involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to
enhance users’ perception. These challenges significantly limit
current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in
generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we
focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG
task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length,
semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic
explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent opti-
mization framework that iteratively alternates between objective
extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse
requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support
this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus
with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames,
a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names
that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing
meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods
spanning various LLM backbones without any training.

I. INTRODUCTION
Benefiting from large-scale model parameters and exten-
sive training data, large language models (LLMs) [1]–[4]
have not only achieved notable breakthroughs in language
understanding [5], [6] and reasoning [7]–[9], but also un-
locked the potential of Creative Natural Language Generation
(CNLG) [10]–[12]. As a special case of controllable language
generation [13], [14], CNLG emphasizes the novelty, distinc-
tiveness, and aesthetics of generated text, which empowers
a spectrum of downstream tasks [15]–[17], spanning from
poetry generation [18]–[20], story writing [21], [22], summa-
rization [23]–[25], and slogan generation [26].
Existing CNLG studies [10], [18]–[24], [26]–[30] mainly
focus on achieving general objectives, e.g., creativity, fluency,

and coherence. However, in real-world CNLG applications,
e.g., naming design and slogan creation, existing methods
face two primary challenges. Challenge 1: Multi-objective
flexibility. User requirements for creativity are often personal-
ized, fine-grained, and multi-objective [31]–[33], while LLMs
struggle to satisfy these diverse goals simultaneously [34].
Challenge 2: Interpretive complexity. According to cognitive
psychology theories [35], [36], creativity is not only reflected
in the generation process, but also involves understanding and
interpreting the implicit meanings [37] behind the content to
enhance user perception. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in Naming
Chinese Baby (NCB), a typical CNLG task, a generated name
is required to meet multiple explicit user-specified require-
ments, e.g., traditional Chinese cultural significance, parents’
expectations for the baby, Bazi&Wuxing 1 and personal char-
acteristics (see Fig. 2 for examples). Besides, corresponding
high-quality explanations are needed to help users understand
the underlying connection between the generated name and
user requirements (like expectation), as well as implicit mean-
ings and aesthetics. Such challenges place greater demands
on the LLMs’ capabilities for understanding, integration, and
interpretability. As a result, existing LLMs are often regarded

Overview of NAMEGEN. Steps 1.1 and 1.2 constitute the multi-objective information preparation process, which is primarily handled by MOM
and MOE. The dynamic iterative objective optimization process includes Steps 2 and 3: Step 2 is managed by MOG, while Step 3 reflects MOE’s role in
evaluating the generation results. The green block at the bottom right illustrates the complete pipeline of NAMeGEn.
as lacking human-level creativity [38]–[40].
These challenges are more pronounced in short-form
CNLG [41]–[43] compared to the long-form one [44], [45],
as LLMs need to integrate multiple, personalized, and fine-
grained user requirements into a compact piece of text.
Therefore, we focus on short-form CNLG, and propose two
types of objectives grounded in the two challenges introduced
above. (a) Explicit User-specified Objectives (EUOs) refer to
creative requirements explicitly set by users, such as parents’
expectations in the NCB task. (b) Implicit Interpretive Ob-
jectives (IIOs) represent fundamental attributes, e.g., accuracy,
completeness, and clarity, of LLMs’ explanation to connect
the underlying meanings and aesthetics with generated text,
which LLMs should satisfy by default. To sum up, short-form
CNLG involves three goals: (i) EUOs optimization, (ii) IIOs
improvement, and (iii) the balance of both.
These goals are highly relevant to addressing the attribute
degradation issue in Multi-aspect Controllable Text Genera-
tion (MCTG) [46]–[48], where attribute imbalance or conflict
arises during generation [49]–[51]. To handle this problem,
early studies treated the decoding process as a Multi-Objective
Optimization (MOO) process [52] and applied various opti-
mization strategies to balance the different attributes to some
extent. Typical methods include MUCOCO [31], GDC [46],
Mix&Match [53], COLD decoding [54] and MacLaSa [49].
Besides, prefix-tuning [55] was also adopted to achieve multi-
attribute control [47], [48], [50], [51]. Nevertheless, these
methods are mainly designed to satisfy a pre-defined set
of attributes, e.g., toxicity, topic and sentiment, and thus
fail to handle the flexible and fine-grained EUOs and IIOs
(challenges 1 & 2). More recently, with the rapid development
of LLMs, multi-aspect control of LLMs receives increasing
attention, with a focus on multi-instruction constraint opti-
mization via fine-tuning [56]–[58]. Despite good effectiveness,

these methods require substantial computational or data costs.
Moreover, fine-tuning requires access to model parameters,
making these methods incompatible with closed-source LLMs.
In this work, we aim to tackle the multi-objective flexibility
and interpretive complexity challenges of CNLG, and take
NCB as a typical short-term CNLG task. Given the strong
capabilities of LLMs in generation [59] and real-world appli-
cations [60]–[62], we resort to In-Context Learning (ICL) [63]
and multi-agent framework [60] to avoid unaffordable costs
and achieve better flexibility and creativity. Since existing
related work predominantly concentrates on reasoning tasks
and thus is less suitable for multi-objective optimization
issues [64]–[66], we propose a Novel Agent-based Multi-
Personalized-Goal Enhancement Framework (NAMeGEn) to
tackle the two challenges and achieve EUOs and IIOs. As
shown in Fig. 2, NAMeGEn performs a two-stage process,
i.e., multi-objective information preparation and dynamic it-
erative objective optimization, which are executed through
three agents, namely, Multi-Objective Manager (MOM), Multi-
Objective Generator (MOG), and Multi-Objective Evaluator
(MOE). MOM is responsible for task analysis and information
processing, while MOG generates a creative result by inte-
grating user queries with MOM-processed information. MOE
participates in evaluating MOM’s search to support MOG’s
generation and assesses MOG’s outputs to ensure a balanced
multi-objective creative outcome. The three agents collectively
work on key information extraction, dynamic generation, and
objective evaluation in an alternating and interactive manner,
towards ultimately achieving optimal creative outcomes. The
whole framework is backbone-agnostic, training-free, and ef-
ficient, allowing the integration with arbitrary either open-
source or black-box LLMs. Since we select NCB as a typical
CNLG task to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
we further develop a benchmark named CBNames. Given
that cultural meaning (e.g., aesthetics and poeticness) is often
considered in Chinese names and LLMs might produce hallu-
cinations, we further collect an ancient Chinese poetry dataset
(denoted as CPoetry), utilize it via Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) [67], and design novel tailored metrics
for this task considering both EUOs and IIOs. Experiments
on various LLM backbones demonstrate the efficacy and
superiority of NAMeGEn in short-term multi-objective CNLG,
outperforming six recent strong baselines.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
• We propose NAMeGEn, a novel framework for solving
hybrid multi-objective optimization in short-term CNLG
tasks. With training-free dynamic iterative optimization
strategies, NAMeGEn achieves a balance among multi-
EUOs, multi-IIOs, and the trade-offs between them, im-
proving content quality and ensuring applicability across
both open-source and closed-source models.
• We have developed a benchmark (CBNames) for the NCB
task and created a new classical poetry retrieval database
(CPoetry) to reduce hallucinations in LLMs.
• Our framework outperforms existing methods across all
six backbone models, demonstrating superior creative
generation and enhanced interpretability without requir-
ing model-specific training.
II. RELATED WORK
Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG) is a
long-standing research area, with classic tasks including poetry
generation [19], [20], story writing [21], [22], summariza-
tion [23], [24], and slogan generation [26]. These studies
primarily focus on objectives such as novelty, originality,
fluency, and diversity of generated text. While these metrics
are vital for assessing generation quality, they often overlook
more personalized and nuanced goals required in real-world
applications. In practice, existing approaches struggle with
multi-objective flexibility (challenge 1). On the other hand,
most prior work emphasizes generation outcomes while un-
derestimating the importance of interpretation for user under-
standing. Creativity also involves understanding and explain-
ing implicit meanings, as highlighted by cognitive psychology
theories [35], [36]. However, current methods largely ignore
interpretive complexity (challenge 2). Our work addresses
these challenges by introducing task analysis and dynamic
multi-objective evaluation strategies.
Multi-Aspect Controllable Text Generation (MCTG)
aims to generate text that satisfies multiple attribute constraints
(e.g., sentiment, topic, style). While traditional methods of-
ten focus on single-aspect control, extending to multi-aspect
scenarios introduces challenges like attribute interference and
degeneration [46]–[51]. Some works frame MCTG as a multi-
objective optimization (MOO) problem. MUCOCO [31] first
formalizes MCTG as MOO by jointly optimizing through
gradient descent for multiple attributes in the loss function.
Similarly, [68] treats detoxification as a multi-objective prob-
lem involving non-toxicity, semantic preservation, and fluency.
However, these works mainly target general attributes like
toxicity, formality, or style, while overlooking more practical
objectives, such as flexible, fine-grained user instructions and
implicit interpretive goals. Although recent work [10], [56]–
[58], [69] explores multi-constraint instruction following, few
adopt explicit MOO frameworks, making it difficult to manage
conflicting constraints effectively.
LLM Based Multi-Agent. Given the strong reasoning
and planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
LLM-based agents have seen rapid development. Compared
to single-agent systems that solve problems through tool
use and interactions with external environments, multi-agent
systems emphasize decision-making through role-playing and
communication among multiple agents [70]–[72]. However,
the use of multi-agent systems has primarily focused on
solving complex tasks [30], [73], [74]. To the best of our
knowledge, no prior work has explored leveraging multi-agent
collaboration to explicitly address multi-objective tasks, which
is a gap our work seeks to fill.
III. METHODLOGY
A. Overview
In this section, we formally introduce the task of multi-
objective optimization in creative natural language generation
(CNLG) and the proposed method. CNLG involves optimizing
explicit user-specified objectives (EUOs), implicit interpretive
objectives (IIOs), and the trade-offs between them, constituting

a hybrid multi-objective optimization problem. The goal of
CNLG is to achieve optimization over this hybrid multi-
objective setting. First, we formalize this task as follows:
Y = arg max
θ
f(x, Oexp, Oimp)
(1)
where Y = {r, E} denotes the final output of it, with the
generated text r and a set of explanations E. For example,
in the Naming Chinese Baby (NCB) task, r is the gener-
ated name, and E is the corresponding set of explanations
detailing how the name reflects each objective. θ is a dynamic
optimization parameter, x is input, Oexp = {oe
1, oe
2, . . . , oe
m}
and Oimp = {oi
1, oi
2, . . . , oi
n} means m EUOs, IIOs respec-
tively, E is also composed of m individual explanations
{e1, e2, . . . , em}, corresponding to EUOs.
In our work, we design a training-free and multi-agent
collaborative architecture, NAMeGEn, to reach this aim. The
overview of NAMeGEn is shown in Fig. 2. Our pipeline is
collaboratively executed by three intelligent agents, including
the Multi-Objective Manager (MOM) AM, the Multi-Objective
Generator (MOG) AG, and the Multi-Objective Evaluator
(MOE) AE (as shown in the green block of Fig. 2). Next,
we divide the whole pipeline into two stages. The first stage
is multi-objective information preparation (see steps 1.1 and
1.2 in Fig. 2). It covers task analysis, key information ex-
traction and expansion, EUO description, and interpretability
requirement design, aiming to build a solid foundation for
hybrid multi-objective generation. This stage is completed by
collaboration between MOM AM and MOE AE. The second
stage is dynamic iterative objective optimization (see steps 2
and 3 in Fig. 2). In this stage, MOG AG drafts a creative
output using information from MOM AM, then dynamically
and iteratively refines it based on MOE AE’s evaluation and
feedback against EUOs and IIOs. This way of optimization
helps to progressively refine the CNLG by balancing hybrid
multi-objectives. Next, we elaborate on each stage in detail.
B. Multi-objective Information Preparation
This stage involves analyzing the creative task and process-
ing multi-objective information, which aims to gain a deeper
understanding of user personalized requirements and enhance
the ability to interpret implicit meaning, helping to produce
higher-quality creative results later.
1) Task analysis process (see 1.1 in Fig. 2): This includes
identifying the task type Itype ←AM(x) (e.g., naming a
Chinese baby), get Oexp = {oe
1, oe
2, . . . , oe
m}, and estimating
user preference scores for Oexp. Specially, when EUOs Oexp
are not provided by user, MOM AM can automatically parse
appropriate EUOs, by Oexp ←AM(Itype). However, when
auto-parsing objectives, the model often parses similar ones
(e.g., ”Harmonious Pronunciation”, ”Easy to Pronounce and
Remember”, etc.). Therefore, we introduce evaluation, ensur-
ing the independence and appropriateness of each objective.
Then the final EUOs we get by Oexp ←AM(Itype, b), where
the evaluation feedback b ←AE(Oexp, Itype). We estimate user
preference by Ipref ←AM(Oexp, x) and normalize it into a
weight vector Wexp. This helps to better meet different users’
personalized needs. Later, this weight Wexp will work in the
dynamic iterative objective optimization stage.

if i < nf then Execute coarse filtering R′ ←ffilter(Iki).

Evaluate: Irk ←AE(R, x) if found, else qi ←AE(R, x, qi).
9 until Irk is found or i > nr max.
10 if i > nr max then Irk ←AE(H, x).
2) Process multi-objective information (1.2 in Fig. 2):
This covers extracting and expanding information, retrieving
related knowledge, and refining the EUOs’ description and
explanatory requirements. Firstly, AM extracts key content Iki
(e.g., surname and date of birth in the naming task) from user
input x, for use in retrieval and expansion. If insufficient, it
can infer additional details (e.g., deducing the birth season
based on the date of birth) to enrich Iki. Next, we add a
retrieval step (shown as in Algorithm 1) into AM to mitigate
the hallucination of LLMs in domain knowledge. User input
x, with its multi-aspect content, also makes this retrieval
process a multi-objective task. Specifically, MOM AM first
uses information Iki to retrieve preliminary candidates R′.
Then, based on x, it reconstructs a style-aligned query q with
the knowledge base (KB), to retrieve the top-k candidates
R = {r1, r2, . . . , rm} from R′, using an embedding-based
retrieval strategy 2. Style rewriting for query q can help to
increase the efficiency of retrieval. To find the best knowledge
Irk, we make MOE AE participate in evaluation and rerank
(see line 7 in Algorithm 1). During evaluation, if none is
satisfactory, MOE AE further revises the query q but keeps
its style. The revised query q is fed back to MOM AM,
which discards previous results and performs a new retrieval
from the remaining knowledge. This process iterates until the
optimal Irk is found. To help MOG better understand EUOs
and try to align with IIOs, MOM AM designs separately
detailed descriptions Idesc = {c1, c2, . . . , cm} and explanatory
requirements Ireqs = {q1, q2, . . . , qm}. Descriptions Idesc are
more reliable information than EUOs’ keywords Oexp, and
requirements Ireqs help MOG AG generate more accurate,
complete, and clear content. Notably, their incorporation can
effectively enhance the efficiency of the hybrid multi-objective
optimization process, thereby contributing to the generation
of creative outputs with improved quality and interpretability.
MOE AE is also involved in this process, ensuring the ratio-
nality of these contents by evaluation, feedback, and iteration.
These steps are as follows:
(Idesc, Ireqs) ←AM(x, Oexp, Iki, Irk, b)
(2)
bdetail ←AE(Idesc, Ireqs)
(3)
where bdetail is the evaluation feedback. Moreover, they will
serve as crucial evaluation criteria in the dynamic iterative ob-
jective optimization stage. Ultimately, we obtain the expanded

hybrid information set: I = {Itype, Ipref, Irk, Idesc, Ireqs} All the
above information is stored in MOM’s memory to facilitate
interactions with other intelligent agents.
C. Dynamic Iterative Objective Optimization
Algorithm 2 shows the process of this stage. MOG AM
utilizes the user query x and the hybrid information I from
MOM to generate the initial results Y = {r, E}, where r is
result and E is its explanation set {ej
1, ej
2, . . . , ej
m}. Afterward,
MOE AE evaluates the completion of Y in EUOs and IIOs
separately, based on Idesc and Ireqs. Our work defines three
IIOs—accuracy, completeness, and clarity—and evaluates this
aspect first, as MOE AE’s understanding of EUOs’ completion
depends on them. Evaluating accuracy is essential for mitigat-
ing model hallucinations. In our work, MOE AE adopts a rule-
based approach Facc and refers to information I for evaluation.
Given the subjectivity of completeness and clarity, rule-based
methods are no longer applicable. Therefore, MOE AE de-
signs a new scoring mechanism to measure their performance
respectively. To integrate them, we provide a trans-function:
θimp = Wimp · Simp
(4)
Wimp = [ 1
n, 1
n, . . . , 1
n] ∈Rn
(5)
where θimp represents the implicit performance, Wimp is the
weight vector, Simp is the score vector of IIOs. In this way,
it mathematically converts the optimization for IIOs into a
single-objective optimization problem.
We similarly evaluate each EUO and combine them to form
the score vector Sexp. Different from traditional optimization
logic, due to the user input x usually implying their potential
preference for EUOs, it is necessary to decompose x and
obtain the preference Ipref (from MOE AE) as the optimization
weight vector Wexp. Here, EUOs’ unified quantitative result is:
θexp = Wexp · Sexp
(6)
Moreover, expected criteria ψimp and ψexp are introduced to
judge implicit and explicit quantification results, respectively.
It is worth noting that except for the generated content, the
criteria ψimp and ψexp adjust dynamically with the iteration:
ψimp =
(
δ
jimp < tw
δ
α·log(jimp+tw)
jimp > tw
(7)
ψexp =
(
δ
jexp < tw
δ
α·log(jexp+tw)
jexp > tw
(8)
where jimp is implicit evaluation round counter, jexp is explicit
evaluation round counter, tw is warmup round, δ is initial
threshold, and α is decay factor. Thanks to this dynamic
iteration process, the generation quality is improved while
multiple explicit objectives are achieved in balance.

IV. EXPERIMENTS
A. Experimental Setup
1) Datasets: To validate the effectiveness of our frame-
work, we conduct Naming Chinese Babies (NCB) as a typical
short-term Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG)
task. NCB is required to consider various factors in creating a
short name, making it a significant challenge. Firstly, we use
a large language model (LLM), through manual verification,
to simulate 500 human naming requests, create a benchmark
(called CNames). This data encompasses over 200 Chinese
surnames, including compound surnames, and reflects a range
of potential user considerations in the naming process, such as
traditional Chinese cultural significance, parental expectations,
the Bazi&Wuxing, personal characteristics, and other special
requirements. User preferences are annotated per objective for
each query. In China, parents often draw on classical poetry
to give their names cultural depth. However, LLMs frequently
make factual errors in the poetry domain. To address this, we
collect and expand a dataset of classical Chinese poetry (called
CPoetry) containing 176,450 entries with metadata such as
poets, dynasties, titles, content, interpretations, and themes.

2) Baseline Methods: We compare our proposed frame-
work, NAMeGEn, with the following methods. Base is the
raw query with task description. CoT [75] involves appending
the phrase “Let’s think step by step” to the input. TDB [76] is
the zero-shot prompting with “Take a deep breath and work on
this problem step-by-step”. Few-shot [77] adds a few demon-
stration exemplars of question-answer in prompt. Q2Kw [78]
integrates retrieved knowledge into the prompt by first using
an LLM to generate results from the user’s raw requirement,
then combining these results with the original requirement to
form an extended query for knowledge retrieval. LLM-D [30]
uses multiple agents to conduct a multi-stage discussion to
complete a creative and diverse response task.
3) Evaluation and Metrics: Recent research has shown the
capability of LLM to emulate human judgment and effectively
evaluate content [79]–[81]. In this work, to evaluate quantita-
tively, we use both LLM and human evaluations.
In LLM evaluation, we propose metrics to evaluate the
performance of Explicit User-specified Objectives (EUOs),
Implicit Interpretive Objectives (IIOs), and their overall op-
timization. In other words, these are designed to evaluate how
well different methods address Hybrid Multi-Objective Opti-
mization (HMOO) and creative diversity in short-term CNLG.
Firstly, for EUOs, we design Explicit multi-objective Com-
pleteness (EC) and Standard Deviation based EC (EC std):
EC = 1
N
N
X
i=1
Pm
j=1 wi,jsi,j

EC std = 1



si,j


2
(10)
where si,j and wi,j denote the score and user weight for the the
j-th objective of i-th sample, with m EUOs and N samples.
si,j is scored by LLM. Higher EC implies better performance
in achieving multi-EUOs. EC std quantifies the balance of
multi-EUOs’ performance via standard deviation, where a
lower score means better. Secondly, we evaluate different
IIOs’ performance, using ACC, CRC, LR, which separately
measure hallucination degree, semantic quality (comprehen-
siveness, relevance, clarity), and logical consistency. For all
of them, a higher score indicates better performance. Subse-
quently, we compute Implicit Multi-Objective Completeness
(IC) and Standard Deviation based IC (IC std). IC is the
average of ACC, CRC, and LR. IC std is their standard
deviation. Higher IC indicates better multi-IIO performance,
while lower IC std reflects more balanced and stable results.
The following describes the method for calculating IC std:
IC std = 1
N
N
X
i=1
v

k∈{ACC,CRC,LR}
(si,k −¯si)2
(11)
where ¯si is the mean of the i-th sample’s scores on ACC, CRC,
and LR, with si,k denoting the score for the k-th objective. Fi-
nally, from a holistic view, we provide Comprehensive Multi-
Objective Completeness (CC), Standard Deviation-based CC
(CC std), and Diversity (DIV). CC averages EC and IC;
CC std averages their standard deviations. DIV scores unique-
ness across methods for the result of each sample, where if
it appears in other methods, it scores 0; otherwise, 1. Higher
DIV indicates better diversity. CC std is calculated as follows:
CC std = 1
N
N
X
i=1
σi
(12)
σi =
r
1
2 ((ECi −¯xi)2 + (ICi −¯xi)2)
(13)
where σi means the standard deviation, ¯xi denote the average
of EC and IC for sample i. In short, EC and EC std reflect the
performance and balance of multi-EUO optimization. ACC,
CRC, and LR measure explanation quality, while IC and
IC std evaluate the performance and balance of multi-IIO
optimization. CC and CC std can capture the overall com-
pleteness and balance of both EUOs and IIOs. DIV compares
the diversity of results across methods.
In human evaluation, we randomly sample 50 test cases,
each evaluated by 3 annotators on a 0–3 scale. EUOs are
scored based on completeness, while IIOs are evaluated in
CRC and LR. In addition, annotators are also asked to identify
the best response among the different methods for each case.
4) Implementation Details: To ensure consistency, the NCB
task prompt includes five objectives: traditional Chinese cul-
tural significance, parental expectations, Bazi&Wuxing, per-
sonal characteristics, and other special requirements. We use
the following seven LLMs as backbones: Qwen (long) [82],
GLM-4 [83], DeepSeek (V3) [84], Mistral (small-latest) [85],
emini (1.5-flash) [83], and GPT4o [59]. Among them,
Qwen [82], GLM-4 [83] and DeepSeek [84] are LLMs profi-
cient in Chinese, while Mistral [85], Gemini [83], and GPT-
4o [59]are LLMs proficient in English. For DeepSeek [84], we
adopt the recommended setting (temperature=1.5) to enhance
creative generation. We use Kimi [86] as the LLM evaluator.
ACC is computed via LLM extraction and rule-based methods.
Other metrics, rated from 0 (invalid) to 3 (excellent), are
averaged and normalized to a 0–100 scale.

1) LLM Evaluation Results: Table I shows that NAMeGEn
consistently outperforms all baselines across backbones and
metrics, confirming its effectiveness in NCB. Fig. 3 further
shows it achieves the lowest EC std, IC std, and CC std,
highlighting its superior balance in EUOs, IIOs, and their
combination. We next analyze the HMOO challenge from
three perspectives: overall, EUOs, and IIOs.
Overall, Table I shows that backbone differences impact
performance partially. Firstly, Chinese-oriented models gener-

ally outperform English ones. For instance, under the Base,
CC reaches 80.66 with Qwen but drops to 75.11 with Mistral.
Similarly, models with stronger contextual understanding (e.g.,
DeepSeek, GPT-4o) perform better. In Few-shot, for example,
CC with GPT-4o reaches 86.51, which is 5.94 points higher
than with Mistral (80.57). In contrast to other methods’
fluctuation across backbones, NAMeGEn shows consistently
strong performance, demonstrating superior robustness and
cross-backbone generalizability. Otherwise, Fig. 3 shows that
balance mainly depends on methods, not backbones. Although
all methods boost diversity (DIV rise compared to Base in
Table I), NAMeGEn achieves the highest creative diversity,
likely owing to more effective iterative guidance.
For multi-EUOs’ optimization in the NCB task, in-context
methods demonstrate better improvements in both creativity
and balance compared to reasoning-based ones. As shown in
Table I, reasoning-based methods provide limited achievement
in explicit objectives, with notable declines in some cases. For
example, with GLM-4, CoT’s EC is 80.25, which is lower than
the Base’s 88.37 (a drop of 8.12), highlighting CoT’s limita-
tions in CNLG, as also discussed in [87]. In contrast, few-
shot improves explicit performance by introducing additional
examples (e.g., Few-shot’s EC rises from Base’s 88.37 to 94.10

on GLM-4). Regarding balance, Fig. 3 shows that few-shot
still significantly outperforms reasoning-based methods (CoT,
TDB). The underlying cause is shown in Fig. 4a: reasoning-
based methods perform well on common objectives (e.g., O1,
O5) but struggle with others. Notably, most baselines also
underperform on complex, rarer objectives (e.g., O3, O4).
This imbalance highlights the limited their limited adapt-
ability to diverse creative objectives. Retrieval-based methods
offer cultural knowledge that helps on objectives like O1
but introduce noise that negatively impacts others (O2–O5).
Consequently, Q2Kw often performs worse than Base in terms
of EC and EC std (see Table I, Fig. 3). Traditional agent-based
methods such as LLM-D struggle on O4 (Fig. 4a), indicating
a need for more effective information expansion beyond user
input. Accordingly, NAMeGEn integrates the strengths of in-
context learning with more accurate expansion and retrieval
to reduce noise. Supported by explicit objective guidance
and iterative dynamic optimization, NAMeGEn demonstrates
strong adaptability to diverse EUOs. It achieves the highest EC
and lowest EC std (Table I, Fig. 3), validating NAMeGEn’s
effectiveness in optimizing multi-EUOs for NCB.
As shown in Table I, all baselines achieve an unsatisfactory
for explainability (IC<90). Fig. 4b offers a fine-grained view.
Firstly, in reasoning-based methods, CoT exhibits unstable and
poor ACC, CRC, and LR across backbones, with no clear
trend. Although TDB improves logic (↑LR), ACC and CRC
remain unstable, explaining their underperformance for IIOs’
optimization (e.g., higher IC std for CoT in Fig.3). Few-
shot enhances explanation completeness (↑CRC) but increases
hallucinations (↓ACC) due to noisy examples, harming both
overall interpretability (e.g., IC drops from 79.29 to 77.68
on GPT-4o, Table I). Similarly, retrieval-based methods help
mitigate hallucinations (↑ACC) at the cost of completeness
(↓CRC), yet the ACC gain yields better interpretability scores
overall (e.g., IC from Base’s 76.29 to 80.05 on Qwen). Tradi-

The performance of three baselines (TDB, Few-shot, LLM-D) and

coefficient r (= 0.63) and a p-value (= 0.0003). (b) show the proportion of

tional agent-based methods (e.g., LLM-D) improve logic and
accuracy (↑LR, ↑ACC) of explanation but show inconsistent
completeness (CRC), resulting in partial interpretability gains
without fully optimizing IIOs. In summary, baselines fail to
balance and optimize all implicit objectives fully. In contrast,
NAMeGEn’s multi-agent collaborative optimization achieves
superior interpretability. As Fig. 5 shows, NAMeGEn’s re-
sults cluster near the Pareto front with high scores (80+),
demonstrating effective multi-objective coordination. Overall,
NAMeGEn robustly optimizes EUOs, IIOs, and their combi-
nation, validating its effectiveness on HMOO.
2) Human Evaluation and Correlation: We compare three
improved baselines (TDB, Few-shot, LLM-D). Fig.6a shows
a Pearson correlation of r = 0.68(> 0.5), p = 0.0003(<
0.001), indicating a statistically significant positive correlation
between human and LLM evaluations. In Fig.6b, annotators
preferred NAMeGEn in 81% of cases, far surpassing Few-
shot (13%), LLM-D (3%), and TDB (3%). These results align
with LLM-based evaluations, validating both NAMeGEn’s
superiority and the reliability of automatic metrics.
C. Ablation Study
We conduct ablation studies on the following settings:
wo/ Imp&Exp: Excludes both descriptions Idesc and require-
ments Ireqs, as well as the implicit and explicit evaluations
dependent on them. wo/ Imp: Excludes Ireqs and implicit
evaluation process based on them. wo/ Exp: Excludes Idesc
and explicit evaluation process based on them. wo/ evalGen:
Removes all evaluation processes involving both Idesc and Ireqs
as criteria (i.e., implicit and explicit evaluation during gener-
ation). wo/ R: Removes the retrieval. wo/ evalR: Excludes
evaluation of the retrieved content.

The results of the ablation study are summarized in Table II.
In wo/ Imp&Exp, most metrics exhibit a notable performance
drop, highlighting the importance of detailed objective guid-
ance and evaluation feedback in HMOO. Moreover, the sharp
decline in ACC (from 94.55 to 63.25) in the absence of
Imp&Exp highlights NAMeGEn’s effectiveness in mitigating
hallucination. Compared to NAMeGEn, the higher LR sug-
gests that the additional information may introduce noise,
which in turn slightly compromises logical rationality. A finer-
grained ablation shows that wo/ Imp has a greater effect on
implicit objective completion (IC from 92.7 to 89.54), while
wo/ Exp more significantly impacts explicit objective balance
(EC std from 5.95 to 7.57), confirming the effectiveness of our
approach in both aspects. In the EC metric, wo/ Imp performs
worse than wo/ Exp. This indicates that optimizing IIOs helps
reach EUOs potentially, which leads to greater improvements
in EC. Furthermore, given the potential correlation between
EUOs and IIOs, such as there is no separation between clearer
explanations and explicit objective completion. Therefore, both
implicit and explicit information and evaluation influence the
completeness and balance of both types of objectives. Finally,
the decline in all metrics for wo/ evalGen demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method’s dynamic evaluation strategy.
Compared to wo/ Imp and wo/ Exp, wo/ evalGen shows
a greater decrease in ACC, indicating that the evaluation
stage has a better effect on hallucination mitigation. The
results in Table III show that wo/ evalR has a decline in
EC(c), indicating that evaluating retrieval content helps find
the matcher knowledge for user needs. The wo/ R performs
poorly in ACC(p), revealing that the retrieval helps mitigate
the LLMs’ hallucination of domain knowledge. In summary,
the ablation results validate the effectiveness of different

components of our multi-agent collaborative framework with
dynamic iterative HMOO.
D. Efficiency Analysis
Fig. 7 shows the interaction requests and density distribution
at different stages of NAMeGEn. Fig. 7a exhibits the distribu-
tion of total API requests during the task. Most require only
5-10 requests, with a peak around 6, indicating high interaction
efficiency, and can converge. Fig. 7b shows the distribution of
interaction rounds across different stages. In the retrieval stage,
most interactions are concentrated in lower rounds, indicating
quick information retrieval. In the generation and evaluation
stages, most require only 2-3 rounds of generation and 1-2
rounds of evaluation, reflecting optimization efficiency. Over-
all, these distribution features exhibit a clear concentration
with a sparse tail, where the proportion of low-frequency,
high-round requests is lower. This indicates that NAMeGEn
can achieve task completion with limited interaction costs in
most cases, demonstrating excellent convergence and stability.
Fig. 8 illustrates the dynamics score during NAMeGEn’s
iterative process. The threshold (dashed line) is initially set at
a higher level and gradually decreases over iterations, allowing
for adaptive convergence control. The actual scores (solid
lines) generally stay above these thresholds, suggesting that
the method consistently meets or exceeds evaluation criteria.
This indicates a strong convergence capability of our method.
E. Qualitative Evaluation
Since DeepSeek performs the best among Chinese LLMs,
we choose it as the backbone for qualitative evaluation. As

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presents the NAMeGEn framework, a novel
multi-agent collaborative approach designed to address the
challenges of Hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization (HMOO)
in Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), particularly
in short-text tasks like Naming Chinese Babies (NCB). By em-
ploying a dynamic iterative hybrid multi-objective optimiza-
tion strategy, NAMeGEn meets user-specified objectives while
ensuring high-quality explanations in terms of factuality, com-
pleteness, and clarity. Experimental results on the CBNames
benchmark demonstrate the framework’s flexibility and adapt-
ability, consistently achieving excellent optimization results
across various backbone models. Furthermore, NAMeGEn
outperforms existing methods by reducing hallucination issues
and providing more logically coherent and completely gener-
ated names. This work contributes to advancing the field of
CNLG and lays a foundation for future research in the domain
of multi-objective optimization.
