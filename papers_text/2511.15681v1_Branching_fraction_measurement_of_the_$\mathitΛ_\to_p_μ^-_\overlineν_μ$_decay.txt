Branching fraction measurement of
the Λ →pµ−νµ decay
LHCb collaboration†
Abstract
A measurement of the branching fraction for the decay Λ→pµ−νµ is presented
using pp collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at a centre-of-mass
energy of 13 TeV. The analysis is based on data recorded between 2016 and 2018,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb−1. The result is obtained using
Λ→pπ−decays as a normalisation channel. The measured branching fraction
is B(Λ→pµ−νµ) = (1.462 ± 0.016 ± 0.100 ± 0.011) × 10−4, where the uncertainties
are statistical, systematic, and due to the limited knowledge of the normalisation
mode branching fraction, respectively. This result improves the precision of the
branching fraction measurement by a factor of two compared to the previous best
measurement and sets a more stringent bound on lepton flavour universality in s→u
quark transitions. It is consistent with previous measurements, and the extracted
lepton flavour universality test observable, Rµe = Γ(Λ→pµ−¯νµ)
Γ(Λ→pe−¯νe) = 0.175±0.012, agrees
with the Standard Model prediction.

Introduction
Precise measurements of b→c transitions have provided hints of lepton flavour universality
(LFU) violation, which could indicate physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) [1,2]. No
such effects have been observed so far in other charged-current decays of down-type quarks.
This paper reports the most precise test to date of LFU in charged-current s→u hyperon
decays. The LHCb experiment has demonstrated excellent capabilities in the study of
strange hadron decays, particularly in searches for rare processes. The collaboration has
reported the most restrictive upper limits on the branching fractions of the K0
S →µ+µ−
and K0
S →µ+µ−µ+µ−decays, and has performed the most precise measurement to date
of the Σ+ →pµ+µ−branching fraction [3–5].
From a theoretical standpoint, semileptonic hyperon decays (SHDs) have been shown
to be sensitive probes of specific beyond-the-SM dynamics that could break LFU [6,7]. The
differential decay rates of these processes are governed by the parameter δ ≡m1−m2
m1
=
∆
m1,
where m1,2 are the masses of the initial (B1) and final (B2) state baryons, and ∆≡m1−m2
denotes their mass difference. The δ parameter quantifies the degree of SU(3) flavour
symmetry breaking in SHDs. Compared to electron final states, decays with muons in
the final state are particularly sensitive to scalar and tensor contributions, which are
suppressed by a factor of mℓ/
p
q2, where mℓis the mass of the charged lepton and q2 is
the squared momentum transferred to the leptonic system. Precision measurements in
this sector therefore complement direct searches for new phenomena at the LHC [6].
The approximate SU(3) flavour symmetry present in hyperons constrains the decay
phase space and permits an expansion of the decay rate in terms of the SU(3) symmetry-
breaking parameter δ, which is approximately 0.159 for the SHD of a Λ particle, when the
final-state baryon is a proton [6,7]. Focusing on the electron mode, for which the electron
mass can be neglected (me ≪∆), the integrated B1 →B2e−¯νe decay rate — assuming
real form factors and expanding in δ up to next-to-leading order (NLO) — is given by [8]

In this expression, f1(0) and g1(0) represent the vector and axial-vector charges of the
hyperon, corresponding to the respective vector and axial-vector form factors evaluated at
zero momentum transfer (q2 = 0), while g2(0) denotes the weak-electric charge. Here, GF
denotes the Fermi constant, and Vus is the CKM matrix element. Notably, the decay rate
exhibits only a weak dependence on the form factors beyond their values at q2 = 0 and
their q2 dependence is expected to play a subleading role at this level of approximation.
Furthermore, the contribution from the weak-electric form factor g2(0) can be neglected, as
it is suppressed by symmetry-breaking effects of order δ. Consequently, the SM prediction
for the total decay rate in the electronic mode depends only on the hyperon vector and
axial charges, f1(0) and g1(0). The neglected terms of order O(δ2) in the SU(3)-breaking
expansion are estimated to affect the predicted decay rate at the level of 1 to 5% [6].
The LFU test observable (Rµe), defined as the ratio of the decay rates of the muon and
electron modes, is sensitive to nonstandard scalar and tensor contributions [6]. Moreover,
the dependence on the form factors is anticipated to simplify when considering the ratio
of branching fractions. By operating at NLO one obtains

The LFU test observable defined in Eq. 2 is predicted by theory to be Rµe
NLO = 0.153 ± 0.008
for the Λ →p case [6].1 This prediction is theoretically clean, as it does not depend on
form-factor inputs at this perturbative order, allowing for a straightforward comparison
with experimental measurements. A precise measurement of Rµe implies a constraint on
the Wilson coefficients, since new physics scalar and tensor operators would contribute to
the ratio.
A recent lattice QCD calculation provides the most precise determination to date
of the Λ →p ℓ−¯νℓtransition form factors, including previously neglected second-
class contributions, yielding a value of the muon-to-electron decay rate ratio of
Rµe
LQCD = 0.1735 ± 0.0098 [9]. In addition to the form-factor determination, the same
study establishes a precise relationship between the partial decay rates of the Λ →p ℓ−¯νℓ
decays and the CKM matrix element |Vus|. Specifically, by integrating the differential
decay rates using only lattice QCD inputs—with |Vus| factored out—predictions are
provided for the ratios Γpℓ¯νℓ/|Vus|2 for both the electron and muon modes. Two sets of
predictions [9] are reported: one using baryon masses determined within the same lattice
QCD calculation, and another using experimentally measured baryon masses. The former
adopts a more conservative uncertainty, intended as the main quoted value, to account
for potential uncontrolled systematics in the baryon spectrum and yields

A precise determination of the CKM matrix element Vus is essential for testing
the unitarity of the first row of the CKM matrix, a fundamental property of the SM.
The most accurate measurements of Vus come from kaon decays: leptonic (Kµ2) and
semileptonic (Kℓ3) channels. However, these two approaches yield results that differ at the
3σ level [10,11]. When the Vus measurements are combined with the precisely measured
value of Vud, given that the contribution from Vub element is almost entirely negligible
(approximately 1.3 × 10−5), the unitarity condition |Vud|2 + |Vus|2 + |Vub|2 = 1 shows a

deviation at the 2σ level [10]. This so-called “Cabibbo angle anomaly” has motivated
renewed interest in precision measurements of Vus.
Prospects for studying strange-hadron decays at LHCb, highlighting the Λ→pµ−νµ
channel2 as particularly promising due to its high reconstruction efficiency, are motivated in
Ref. [12]. In 2021, the BESIII collaboration reported the first measurement of the absolute
branching fraction for this decay, obtaining B(Λ→pµ−νµ) = (1.48 ± 0.21) × 10−4 [13],
which remains the most precise result from a single measurement to date. The current
world average is (1.51 ± 0.19) × 10−4 [10]. This paper presents a new measurement of
the Λ→pµ−νµ branching fraction with improved precision, and the first study of lepton
flavour universality in hyperon decays at LHCb.

Detector and simulation
The data were collected in proton-proton collisions by the LHCb experiment at a centre-of-
mass energy of 13 TeV between 2016 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity
of 5.4 fb−1. The LHCb detector [14,15] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering
the pseudorapidity range 2 < η < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b
or c quarks. The detector used to collect the data analysed in this paper includes a
high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the
pp interaction region, the VELO, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a
dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 T m, and three stations of silicon-strip
detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet.
The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles
with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c.
The minimum distance of a track to a primary pp collision vertex (PV), the impact
parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/pT) µm, where pT is the
component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged
hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors.
Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of
scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter.
Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire
proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which
consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems,
followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. Triggered data
further undergo a centralised, offline processing step, referred to here as the preselection,
to deliver physics-analysis-ready data across the entire LHCb physics programme [16].
Simulation is required to model the effects of the detector acceptance and the imposed
selection requirements. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [17]
with a specific LHCb configuration [18].
Decays of unstable particles are described
by EvtGen [19], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [20]. The
interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented
using the Geant4 toolkit [21] as described in Ref. [22].
Three main simulated samples are used in this analysis: the signal decay, Λ→pπ−
decays, and a minimum-bias sample generated to emulate collision events selected by
a dedicated random trigger in data. The signal decays are simulated using a custom

EvtGen model, that implements the theoretical differential decay rate of SHDs [23],
in order to reproduce the correct kinematic distributions. These samples are weighted
to account for observed differences in the Λ transverse momentum and pseudorapidity
distributions relative to data (see Sec. 7.1).

Analysis overview
The measurement of the branching ratio of the decay Λ→pµ−νµ is performed
relative to the Λ→pπ−decay,
whose branching ratio has been measured as
B(Λ→pπ−) = 0.641 ± 0.005 [10].
Two sets of preselection criteria are applied: one
for the normalisation channel and the other for the signal channel. The two preselections
are designed to be as similar as possible, such that systematic uncertainties largely cancel
in the ratio. The only differences arise from particle-identification requirements and the
mass hypothesis used in the reconstruction. A detailed description of the preselection
criteria is given in Sec. 5, which also describes the selection requirements used to further
isolate the signal from physical backgrounds arising from Λ→pπ−and K0
S →π+π−
decays.
The Λ→pµ−νµ branching ratio can be expressed as
B(Λ→pµ−νµ) = B(Λ→pπ−) ϵΛ→pπ
ϵΛ→pµνµ
NΛ→pµνµ
NΛ→pπ
= αNΛ→pµνµ ,
(8)
where ϵΛ→pπ and ϵΛ→pµνµ are the selection efficiencies for the normalisation and signal
channels, respectively, and NΛ→pπ and NΛ→pµνµ are the corresponding yields. All values
except for NΛ→pµνµ are included in the normalisation constant α.
In the offline selection, trigger signals are associated with reconstructed particles.
Selection requirements can therefore be made on the trigger selection itself and on
whether the decision was due to the signal candidate, other particles produced in the
pp collision, or a combination of both. Thanks to the high Λ production rate at the
LHC—approximately one Λ per primary interaction [12]— this analysis can be performed
selecting only candidates that are triggered independent of signal (TIS). Although this
requirement reduces the overall trigger efficiency, it ensures consistency between the signal
and normalisation modes, thereby reducing the impact of systematic uncertainties.

Variable definitions
The minimum-bias simulation sample is used to study the background composition
after applying the signal candidate preselection described in Sec. 5. It is found that
approximately 60% of selected Λ→pµ−νµ candidates originate from either Λ→pπ−or
Λ→pπ−(→µ−νµ) decays, where the pion decays in flight. Given the similarity between
the background and signal topologies, a dedicated strategy is optimised to enhance their
separation. This involves exploiting the distinct kinematic features of each decay mode to
construct discriminating variables for the candidates passing the signal preselection.
Since the decay Λ→pπ−(→µ−νµ) constitutes the main source of background for this
measurement, the first step is to classify such decays—misidentified as signal candidates—
into two categories depending on the pion decay point. In the first case, the pion decays
within the VELO volume, and the resulting muon leaves hits in that subdetector. In

and imposing the Λ mass. In the case shown on the right, the pion momentum is corrected so
that, when added to the proton momentum, the total points back to the PV.
the second case, the pion traverses the entire VELO before decaying, and the hits in the
subdetector originate exclusively from the pion. The topology of the two categories is
shown in Fig. 1.
4.1
Longitudinal neutrino momentum
In the first case, which occurs in approximately 35% of the selected Λ→pπ−(→µ−νµ)
decays, the pion decays into a muon and a neutrino within the VELO volume. In both
these cases and in signal decays, the neutrino transverse momentum, pT(νµ), can be
inferred from the momentum components of the proton and the muon. This is done using
the Λ flight direction, defined as ⃗f = ⃗
SV −⃗
PV , where ⃗
PV and ⃗
SV denote the positions
of the primary and secondary vertices, respectively. The Gram–Schmidt procedure [24]
is then applied to construct an orthonormal basis: ˆxu = (−ˆfy, + ˆfx, 0) and ˆyu = ˆf × ˆxu.
This orthogonal basis allows for the reconstruction of the missing transverse momentum
component perpendicular to the Λ flight direction, using the following decomposition for
the visible momentum:
⃗p ′
pµ = (⃗ppµ · ˆxu, ⃗ppµ · ˆyu, ⃗ppµ · ˆf) = (p′
pµ,x, p′
pµ,y, p′
pµ,z),
(9)
where
pT(νµ) =

pµ,x + p′2
pµ,y.
(10)
After computing pT(νµ) from the projections of the proton and muon momenta onto
the plane transverse to the Λ flight direction, the longitudinal component pL(νµ) can be
determined by requiring that the invariant mass of the decay products equals the known
Λ mass

The longitudinal neutrino momentum is a key variable for separation of signal candi-
dates from other decay channels. Signal decays yield a positive value inside the square
root of Eq. 13, whereas this is typically not the case for combinatorial background, which
arises from random combinations of tracks that mimic the signal topology but do not
originate from a common decay. In contrast, Λ→pπ−decays without a decaying pion
are expected to give pL(νµ) = 0, with some variation due to the finite resolution of the
momentum measurement. The requirement of a positive argument inside the square
root in Eq. 13 corresponds to the condition pT(νµ) < (m2
Λ −m2
pµ)/2mΛ. Signal decays
satisfy this condition by construction, whilst combinatorial background typically does not.
Background decays of Λ→pπ−yield values close to the boundary, althought events in
which the pion decays in flight are more likely to satisfy the condition.
4.2
Corrected mass
In the second case, when the pion decays to a muon after the VELO, leaving enough hits
in this subdetector to reconstruct a track segment, its momentum direction is known, but
the measured momentum modulus does not correspond to the total pion momentum. In
such cases, the reconstructed Λ momentum vector does not correctly point back to the
primary vertex. The correct ⃗p Corr
π
can be computed requiring the Λ momentum to point
back to the PV.
For Λ→pπ−(→µ−νµ) decays, the corrected pπ invariant mass, mCorr(pπ), computed
using the obtained value of ⃗p Corr
π
, peaks at the known Λ mass [10]. This new variable is
determined by minimising the function
χ2(λ) = 1 −ˆpΛ(λ) · ˆf,
(15)
where λ is a correction factor applied to the pion momentum: ⃗p Corr
π
= λ ⃗pπ. The corrected
Λ momentum is then given by ⃗pΛ = ⃗pp + ⃗p Corr
π
, where ˆpΛ(λ) is its unit vector. The value
of λ that minimizes the χ2 is obtained using the Minuit package [25], and is subsequently
used to compute mCorr(pπ), assuming the proton–pion mass hypotheses.
5
Candidate selection
The preselections require final state particles with a good track-fit χ2, that are consistent
with the decay topology of both the Λ→pµ−νµ and Λ→pπ−decays. All final-state
particles are required to have a significant displacement from any PV. Proton candidates
must be well identified and be incompatible with either the kaon or muon hypotheses.

tion (blue), with the expected signal contribution from simulated Λ→pµ−νµ decays overlaid
(orange), (left) before and (right) after applying the pL(νµ) > 0 requirement, which suppresses
combinatorial background.
Similarly, the companion pion or muon must be incompatible with the kaon identification
hypothesis. The proton and the companion track must originate from a common vertex
with good fit quality χ2, and the reconstructed Λ candidate is required to have a decay
time greater than 9 ps, a visible mass below 1141 MeV/c2, and a reconstructed momentum
vector that points back to the PV.
The signal selection is developed using simulated samples of Λ→pµ−νµ, Λ→pπ−and
minimum-bias candidates. Figure 2 shows a substantial suppression of the combinatorial
background component, achieved by requiring a positive value of pL(νµ). The resulting
sample is primarily composed of background from Λ→pπ−decays, with a visible signal
contribution in the low-side tail of the mCorr(pπ) distribution.
Requiring a positive argument inside the square root in the expression for pL(νµ)
imposes a constraint in the pT(νµ) vs. m(pµ) plane. Consequently, a tighter selection is
applied in this plane (see Fig. 3 (left)). In addition, a requirement in the Armenteros–
Podolanski [26] plane (pT of the oppositely charged decay products with respect to the Λ
direction of flight vs the longitudinal momentum asymmetry αAP = (p+
L −p−
L )/(p+
L + p−
L ))
is introduced, selecting candidates in Fig. 3 (right) within the yellow ellipse or below the
green curve, where the signal density is higher. An additional requirement of mCorr(pπ) <
1160 MeV/c2 and m(pπ) < 1120 MeV/c2, where no signal is expected, is imposed. Regarding
the normalisation channel, a requirement is imposed in the Armenteros–Podolanski plane
to remove the K0
S →π+π−contribution.
6
Normalisation and signal yield
The normalisation yield is obtained from a fit to the m(pπ) distribution of candidates
in data that pass the selection criteria for the normalisation channel. To model the
Λ→pπ−shape, simulation is used to obtain a description of the m(pπ) distribution of
the Λ→pπ−decays. The model consists of the sum of a Crystal Ball function [27],
a modified Gaussian function which includes tails on both sides of the peak, and a
Johnson SU distribution [28]. The parameters are determined from an extended unbinned

maximum-likelihood fit to the mass distribution of the selected simulated candidates.
The tail parameters of the Crystal Ball and Johnson SU functions are constrained with
Gaussian priors to the result of the Λ→pπ−simulation fit, while the peak position and
the core width are allowed to vary freely in the fits to data, to account for known residual
data-simulation differences. The fit to data, shown in Fig. 4 (right), determines a total
normalisation yield of NΛ→pπ−= (9.9337 ± 0.0018) × 107, with the background modelled
by an exponential function.
The signal yield is measured using a binned maximum-likelihood fit, following the
procedure described in Ref. [29], in bins of the mCorr(pπ) vs. m(pπ) plane, with the
binning shown in Fig. 5. The fitter uses the observed bin counts as input, with the
expectation determined from simulated histograms, and returns the fitted yields for each
contribution. A Poisson-based log-likelihood is used to account for limited sample size.

where Nobs is the observed number of selected events in the bin and ˆN is the expected
sum of all components in that bin, obtained from the simulation templates. The latter is
computed using the fraction of each component in the bin and the overall yield of each
component as determined by the fit.
The binning scheme consists of 11 bins in the two-dimensional mCorr(pπ) vs. m(pπ)
plane. The signal is primarily concentrated along the diagonal where mCorr(pπ) = m(pπ).
Bin 1, located on this diagonal, is expected to have the highest signal purity. The adjacent
bins to the left (Bin 2) and right (Bin 3) also exhibit high signal purity. These three bins
contribute the most to the sensitivity for determining the signal yield in data. Bin 7,
located near the centre of the plane, is dominated by background and is intentionally
designed to cover the region with the most concentrated background. Bins 5 and 9, adjacent
to this central region, contain a significant mixture of both signal and background, which
helps to constrain the relative contributions in the fit. The remaining bins serve as control
regions, contributing to the overall robustness of the fit.
The fit is performed using simulation templates for
Λ→pµ−νµ,
Λ→pπ−,
Λ→pπ−(→µ−νµ), and the combinatorial background. The latter is modelled with candi-
dates from the minimum-bias sample that pass the full signal selection but do not match any
of the decays listed above. The resulting signal yield is NΛ→pµνµ = (1.637 ± 0.016) × 104,
where the uncertainty accounts for both the statistical fluctuations and the uncertainty in
the simulation templates, which is accounted for by repeating the fit 10 000 times using
Poisson-fluctuated templates, and taking the standard deviation of the fitted yields as the
uncertainty.
As a cross-check, a machine-learning algorithm is used for finding the best binning-
scheme to perform the binned fit. Specifically, a DecisionTreeClassifier [30] is used
to identify a new binning scheme with 10 bins. The fit is then performed using this new

Another cross-check is performed using a one-dimensional fit in mCorr(pπ) (Fig. 6),

fully robust fit. This is possible because, although the limited simulated background
statistics prevent the use of a non-parametric modelling such as a kernel density estimate,
the Λ→pπ−and Λ→pπ−(→µ−νµ) background components exhibit a smooth peaking
behaviour that is well described by a double-sided Crystal Ball function. The signal yield
measured by performing this fit, where the signal component is modelled using a Kernel
Density Estimation (KDE), is compatible within 0.3σ of the two-dimensional fit result.
As a final check, the one-dimensional fit to the mCorr(pπ) distribution is repeated in four
bins of pT(Λ) using the same model as described before. The results in each of the four
pT bins are compatible with the central value of the baseline fit within 1σ.

Efficiency determination
Two key ingredients for the measurement of the branching fraction B(Λ→pµ−νµ) are
the observed signal yield and the signal efficiency, defined as the product of efficiencies
from event generation, reconstruction, preselection, and the selection detailed in Sec. 5.
The signal yield is extracted from a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the full data
sample. The total signal efficiency, determined from simulated signal decays, is found to
be ϵΛ→pµνµ = (1.0542 ± 0.0026) × 10−4.
The efficiency of the normalisation channel is computed by fitting the m(pπ) distri-
bution in a minimum-bias simulation sample that passes the selection criteria for the
normalisation channel, following exactly the same procedure as that used to extract
the normalisation yield (see Fig. 4 left). The fitted yield is then divided by the total
number of generated Λ→pπ−decays in the simulation sample, resulting in an efficiency
of ϵΛ→pπ−= (1.5749 ± 0.0067) × 10−4.
Combining the signal yield and efficiency with those of the Λ→pπ−channel and
10


its branching fraction, the normalisation constant in Eq. 8 is found to be α = (9.640 ±
0.090)×10−9, where the quoted uncertainty, apart from the contribution from B(Λ→pπ−),
is purely statistical and arises from the limited size of the simulated samples and the
uncertainty on the fitted normalisation yield.
7.1
Corrections to simulated samples
All simulation samples are corrected to account for observed differences in the pT(Λ) and
η(Λ) distributions relative to data, using the GBReweighter algorithm from the hep ml
package [31] and the efficiencies are updated. As a signal proxy, Λ→pπ−candidates from
data passing the normalisation selection are used, where the background contribution is
subtracted using the sPlot technique [32] using the m(pπ) invariant mass as discriminating
variable.
The normalisation constant is further corrected for known data-simulation discrepancies
in particle-identification (PID), tracking, and trigger efficiencies affecting both signal and
normalisation channels. These corrections are evaluated using calibration samples and ded-
icated tools. For PID and tracking, correction factors are computed with PIDCalib2 [33]
and TrackCalib2 [34] tools, in bins of final-state particle’s momentum and pseudorapidity.
The trigger correction accounts for differences in the fraction of TIS events between
the signal and normalisation channels. It is obtained by measuring the TIS fraction in
simulated signal and normalisation channels passing their corresponding preselections and
computing the ratio. The resulting correction factors, which are applied multiplicatively
to the normalisation constant, are CPID = 0.897 ± 0.031, CTracking = 0.995 ± 0.016, and
CTIS = 1.038 ± 0.031, where the quoted uncertainties arise from the limited size of the
simulated samples and from the systematic uncertainty associated with the binning used
to compute the corrections.
The final corrected normalisation constant is
α = (8.928 ± 0.044 (stat) ± 0.436 (syst) ± 0.007 (norm)) × 10−9,
where the first uncertainty combines the different statistical sources, the second uncertainty
accounts for systematic effects described in Sec. 8 and the last arises from the branching
fraction of the normalisation channel.
8
Systematic uncertainties
The entire analysis is structured with the primary goal of minimising systematic uncertain-
ties. It employs data candidates in which the trigger decision was due to other particles
produced in the pp collision and a common preselection is used for both modes, differing
only in the particle-identification criteria applied to muons and pions. Furthermore, these
requirements have been minimised through a kinematics-based selection. As a result, this
approach leads to the cancellation of most systematic uncertainties.
Since Λ→pπ−is used as the normalisation channel, its branching ratio uncertainty
is included as an independent systematic uncertainty. For the particle-identification
and tracking efficiency corrections, the corresponding software tools rely on binning in
kinematic and detector occupancy variables. To account for the associated systematic
11


uncertainty, the variation in the corrected efficiencies under different binning schemes is
evaluated.
The particle-identification-efficiency correction introduces two sources of uncertainty.
The first is statistical, arising from the finite size of the samples used to determine the
correction factor (see Sec. 7.1), which accounts for both the signal and normalisation
efficiencies, and carries an uncertainty of 3.5%. The second originates from the choice of
binning scheme in transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and detector occupancy used
to compute the correction. The associated systematic uncertainty is evaluated, for both
signal and normalisation, as the maximum deviation from the average value among 14
alternative binning schemes, yielding 1.6% for the signal and 1.0% for the normalisation
channel.
The tracking efficiency correction factor also has a statistical component arising from
the finite size of the samples used to determine it, corresponding to an uncertainty of
1.6%. Regarding the intrinsic tracking uncertainty, since the proton tracks are common
to both the signal and normalisation channels, their uncertainties are considered to be
highly correlated and thus cancel in the ratio. A tracking uncertainty of 0.8% is assigned
to the muon and pion tracks individually, and an additional intrinsic uncertainty of 1.4%
is assigned to the pion track due to hadronic interactions. These tracking efficiency uncer-
tainties are assigned following the LHCb prescription of Ref. [34]. The total uncorrelated
tracking uncertainty is therefore 1.8%, computed as
p
(0.8%)2 + (0.8%)2 + (1.4%)2.
The systematic uncertainty associated with the determination of the signal yield is the
dominant source, and is evaluated by considering four alternative binning schemes and
background model configurations. Some binning schemes feature more uniform bin size,
while one includes a narrower diagonal region to better capture the signal concentration
around the mCorr(pπ) = m(pπ) line. Regarding background modelling, the combinatorial
background template is dominated by misidentified Λ→pπ−decays, due to the strong
suppression of true combinatorial events. This can reduce the precision of the fit, as part
of the Λ→pπ−contribution may be absorbed into the combinatorial component, which is
modelled using a simulated sample of significantly smaller size than the Λ→pπ−template.
To explore the impact of these modelling choices, the fit is repeated under two alternative
configurations in which no separate combinatorial background template is used: one in
which the relative contribution of Λ→pπ−and Λ→pπ−(→µ−νµ) background is fixed to
the value observed in simulation after selection, and one in which this ratio is allowed to
float.
The systematic uncertainty on the signal yield due to the fit is evaluated from the
variation in results obtained using alternative binning schemes and fit models, and is
quantified as 3.9%.
Finally, it is assumed that the efficiency of the trigger selection is independent of
the candidate and therefore equal for signal and normalisation candidates passing the
preselection. From first principles, this should be the case, as in both scenarios, the
parent particle is a Λ baryon producing two tracks, and the kinematics of the decay are
nearly identical. This assumption is validated using simulation. The comparison, although
limited by statistical precision, yields a ratio compatible with unity. Nevertheless, given
the sizeable uncertainty, the central value of this ratio is used to correct the total efficiency
(see Sec. 7.1), with the error on the ratio propagated as the uncertainty.
In simulation, about 3.5 % of signal candidates are misclassified when applying the
truth-based selection. This fraction is estimated by fitting the distribution of candidates

for possible differences in the selection efficiency between these misidentified and correctly

efficiencies and relative fractions. The resulting uncertainty is 0.69%.

they are combined in quadrature, yielding a total relative uncertainty of 6.8% on the
branching fraction.

Results and conclusions
This analysis uses data collected by the LHCb experiment from proton-proton collisions
at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during Run 2 of the LHC (2016–2018) to measure
the branching fraction of the Λ→pµ−νµ decay. To avoid experimenter’s bias, the results
were not examined until the full analysis procedure had been finalised. The measurement
presented in this analysis yields
B(Λ→pµ−νµ) = (1.462 ± 0.016 (stat) ± 0.100 (syst) ± 0.011(norm)) × 10−4
= (1.46 ± 0.10) × 10−4,
corresponding to a total uncertainty of 6.9%. This represents a factor two improve-
ment in precision compared to the previous best result, and is consistent with it within
uncertainties [13].
Using the measured branching fraction B(Λ→pµ−νµ) together with the Λ lifetime,
τΛ = (2.617 ± 0.010) × 10−10s [10], the partial decay rate Γ(Λ→pµ−νµ) is obtained.
The CKM matrix element |Vus| is then extracted using lattice QCD form-factor pre-
dictions, yielding |Vus| = 0.235 ± 0.016 with the more conservative input (Eq.(4)) and
|Vus| = 0.2459 ± 0.0085 with the alternative prediction featuring smaller uncertainties but
less conservative assumptions (Eq.(6)).
Although these determinations carry larger uncertainties than those derived from kaon
decays, they provide an independent constraint that is relevant in light of the long-standing
13


tension in global |Vus| fits. Inserting these values into the CKM unitarity relation,
p
|Vud|2 + |Vus|2 + |Vub|2 =
(
1.0016 ± 0.0038
(conservative),
1.0042 ± 0.0021
(smaller uncertainties),
yields results consistent with unitarity of the first row of the CKM matrix.
This measurement enables a test of lepton flavour universality in s→u quark transi-
tions, where any observed deviation from the expectation would constitute evidence for
physics beyond the SM. Using the precisely measured electron-mode branching fraction,
B(Λ→pe−νe) = (8.34 ± 0.14) × 10−4 [10], the experimental LFU ratio is determined as
Rµe
exp = 0.175 ± 0.012. This value is consistent with the main lattice QCD prediction of
0.1735 ± 0.0098 [9] at the 0.1σ level, with the NLO prediction of 0.153 ± 0.008 [6] at 1.5σ,
and with the more precise but less conservative lattice result of 0.16638 ± 0.00020 [9] at
0.95σ.
