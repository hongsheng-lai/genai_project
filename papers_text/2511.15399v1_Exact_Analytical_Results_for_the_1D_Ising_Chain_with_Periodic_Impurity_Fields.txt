Abstract
We present an exact analytical solution for the one-dimensional Ising model
in the presence of an external magnetic field applied periodically to every
k-th site. The problem is handled using the symmetrized transfer matrix ap-
proach, we derive a compact closed-form expression for the system’s eigen-
values for arbitrary period k.
From the resulting free energy, we obtain
exact expressions for the magnetization and zero-field susceptibility.
Ex-
plicit results are presented for k = 1, k = 2, and k = 3 which is considered
a novel result. We further analyze the spin-spin correlation functions, de-
riving the correlation length and the set of position-dependent correlation
strength prefactors, Aij. The framework highlights how impurity spacing
suppresses thermodynamic responses, with susceptibility scaling as χ ∼β/k
for large k, offering insights into diluted magnetic systems and serving as
a benchmark for quasiperiodic modulations. The correlation strengths ex-
hibit a strong anisotropy, revealing a complex, non-local structure of spin
fluctuations. These results provide a complete and rigorous benchmark for
understanding the effects of periodic modulation in 1D systems.

1. Introduction
The one-dimensional (1D) Ising model is one of the most fundamental
examples in statistical physics for understanding interacting spin systems. It
describes a chain of classical spins interacting with their neighbors, and its

exact solution was first achieved by Ernst Ising a century ago [1]. In its sim-
plest form—a ring of N spins σi = ±1 with nearest-neighbour coupling J and
a uniform longitudinal field h—it is exactly solvable via the transfer-matrix
method [2]. This method reduces the problem of summing over all configu-
rations to the simpler algebraic problem of finding the largest eigenvalue of
a small matrix [3]. While the 1D model famously has no finite-temperature
phase transition, its exact solvability provides a rich testing ground for fun-
damental concepts of statistical mechanics [4].
Despite this simplicity, the 1D Ising chain remains an important starting
point for extensions that incorporate spatial inhomogeneity, modulated ex-
ternal fields, or impurity sites. The study of such impurities is a vast field, as
they can fundamentally alter a system’s behavior [5]. Disorder can affect the
stability of symmetry-broken low-temperature phases [6], and even a single
defect can, in some cases, destroy the properties of the system [7]. Even
in quantum analogs, such as the transverse-field Ising model, impurities are
known to tune critical fluctuations [8]. Such generalizations provide solv-
able reference points beyond the homogeneous case and show how deviations
from uniformity affect a system’s thermodynamic and correlation properties.
These modified models bridge the gap between perfect crystalline order and
complete disorder, and have connections to a wide range of topics, including
random-field models [9, 10] and quasiperiodic systems [11]. While the homo-
geneous (k = 1) and dimerized (k = 2) chains are well-understood problems
[12], a general and consistent framework for arbitrary k has been less clear,
underscoring the need for a complete and rigorous solution for general k.
In the present paper, we provide this complete and rigorous solution. We
employ the symmetrized transfer matrix formalism to derive the exact, gen-
eral eigenvalues for an arbitrary period k. From this, we obtain the general
free energy, magnetization, and zero-field susceptibility. We present the well-
known results for k = 1 and k = 2 as a verification of our general method,
and provide the first explicit closed-form solutions for the trimerized (k = 3)
case. We then provide a detailed analysis of the spin-spin correlation func-
tions, deriving the correlation length and the full set of position-dependent
correlation strength prefactors, Aij. Our analysis reveals a rich physical be-
havior, including a non-monotonic correlation length in the presence of a
field and a strong anisotropy in the correlation strengths. These exact re-
sults provide a complete benchmark for the physics of periodic modulation
in 1D spin systems.
Moreover, such models of periodic modulation are not just of theoretical
2


interest. They have direct relevance to real experimental conditions. In ul-
tracold atomic systems, for example, optical superlattices and site-selective
addressing techniques allow for the engineering of systems where every k-th
site experiences a different local potential, making the present model di-
rectly realizable [13, 14]. Similarly, in spintronics and materials science, pe-
riodic nanostructure engineering is a practical method for tuning magnetic
anisotropy in nanomagnetic arrays [15].
2. Methodology
In this section, we outline the transfer matrix approach used to solve the
model [2, 3]. We begin by defining the mathematical framework, including
the Hamiltonian, and then derive the transfer matrices and their eigenvalues.
The partition function and thermodynamic quantities derived from these
eigenvalues are discussed in the subsequent section.
2.1. Mathematical Model
We consider a one-dimensional chain of N Ising spins σi = ±1 (i =
1, . . . , N) with periodic boundary conditions (σN+1 = σ1). The Hamiltonian
is given by [1]:
H = −J
N
X
i=1
σiσi+1 −h
X
j∈I
σj,
(1)
where J > 0 is the ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor coupling constant, h is
the external magnetic field strength, and I denotes the set of impurity sites
where the field is applied. These impurity sites are periodically spaced every
k lattice spacings, such that the field acts only on sites j = mk+1 for integer
m. This setup interpolates between the uniform field case (k = 1) and dilute
impurity limits (large k).
Symmetrizing the Hamiltonian by splitting the field between the two
bonds around each ith site:
H = −
N
X
i=1

Jσiσi+1 + hi
2 σi + hi+1
2 σi+1

(2)
Where hj = h for an impurity site (j ∈I), and zero otherwise.
The
partition function is
Z =
X
{σ}
exp(−βH)
(3)
3


where β = 1/(kBT) is the inverse temperature, and the sum is over all 2N
spin configurations. To solve this exactly, we employ the transfer matrix
method, which exploits the chain’s linear structure and periodicity.
2.1.1. Transfer Matrices and the Eigenvalue Problem
The partition function Z (eq.3) can be written as the trace of a product of
transfer matrices, where each matrix carries the statistical weight from one
site to the next. Defining the matrix element at site i:
⟨σi|Ti|σi+1⟩= exp

βJσiσi+1 + β hi
2 σi + β hi+1
2 σi+1

(4)
Because σi are Ising spins, Ti is a 2x2 matrix:
Ti =
 
eβJeβ
hi+hi+1
2
e−βJeβ
hi−hi+1
2
e−βJe−β
hi−hi+1
2
eβJe−β
hi+hi+1
2
!
= D(β hi
2 )T0D(β hi
2 )
(5)
Here we use:
T0 =
 eβJ
e−βJ
e−βJ
eβJ

,
D(x) =
ex
0
0
e−x

(6)
Notice that D(0) = 1 for zero field and D(t/2) = diag(et/2, e−t/2) for
impurity site (t = βh).
Given the periodicity, we group the chain into unit cells of k sites, each
starting with an impurity site followed by k −1 non-impurity sites. The
transfer matrix for one unit cell is then
Pk = D(t/2)T k
0 D(t/2)
(7)
For a chain with N = Mk sites, the partition function becomes Z = Tr(P M
k ).
To evaluate Pk, we first require a general expression for the n-th power
of the non-field matrix T0. Defining a = eβJ, b = e−βJ:
T0 =
a
b
b
a

with eigenvalues
λ±
0 = a ± b
This is symmetric and diagonalizable, so we can use T n
0 = UΛnU −1 where
U =

is a unitary matrix of the eigenvectors of T0, and the result
is:

where
un = (a + b)n + (a −b)n

So Pk is given by:
Pk =

The characteristic equation det(Pk −λI) = 0 then gives the eigenvalues

(10)
These eigenvalues fully determine the partition function in the thermo-
dynamic limit, from which thermodynamic quantities follow.
3. Thermodynamic quantities
The thermodynamic quantities are derived in the usual way from the
partition function which is now written as Z = Tr(P M
k ) = (λ+
k )M + (λ−
k )M.
In the thermodynamic limit (M →∞) larger eigenvalue dominates and the
partition function is simply Z ≈(λ+
k )M.
Starting with the free energy per site is f = −1

f = −1

The average magnetization per site (over the entire chain) is given by:

With the definitions of uk and vk given in 2.1.1.
These are the exact solutions for general spacing k derived analytically.
For large k, corresponding to the case of diluted fields, tanhk →0 and the
susceptibility obeys Curie - like law:
χ ∼β
k
4. Exact Solutions for Special Cases
Having derived the general expressions for the magnetization m and zero-
field susceptibility χ(0) in terms of uk and vk, we now specialize to small
periods k = 1, 2, 3. These cases serve as benchmarks: k = 1 recovers the
uniform-field 1D Ising model, k = 2 models a dimerized chain with alter-
nating impurities, and k = 3 provides the first explicit closed-form results
for a trimerized configuration, highlighting the framework’s utility for higher
periods. For each, we compute uk and vk explicitly and substitute into the
general formulas, yielding simplified expressions.
4.1. Case k = 1: Uniform Field
For k = 1, every site experiences the field, so u1 = a, v1 = b. Substituting
into the general magnetization formula gives
m =
sinh(βh)
q
sinh2(βh) + e−4βJ
,
(14)
which matches the standard 1D Ising result under uniform field. The zero-
field susceptibility simplifies to
χ(0) = βe2βJ.
(15)
This case exhibits the strongest response, with χ(0) diverging exponen-
tially as T →0, reflecting cooperative alignment.
6


4.2. Case k = 2: Dimerized Chain
For k = 2, impurities alternate, yielding u2 = a2 + b2, v2 = 2ab = 2. The
magnetization becomes
m =
sinh(βh)
2
q
sinh2(βh) + sech2(2βJ)
,
(16)
and the susceptibility is
χ(0) = β
2 cosh(2βJ).
(17)
This represents slower divergence than the exponential in k = 1 case.
4.3. Case k = 3: Trimerized Chain
For k = 3, impurities occur every third site, with u3 = a(a2 + 3b2),
v3 = b(3a2 + b2). Substituting yields the novel closed-form magnetization
m =
sinh(βh)
r
sinh2(βh) + e−12βJ

(18)
and susceptibility
χ(0) = β
3 e6βJ
1 + 3e−4βJ
1 + 3e4βJ

.
(19)
This expression for k = 3 is new and demonstrates further suppression.
However, for weak J or equivalently at high T, the expressions for k = 2 and
k = 3 tend to that for k = 1 (X(0) ∼βe2βJ) except for the additional factor
of 1/k reflecting the fact that m represents the average magnetization over
all the chain not only over the impurity sites (mimp)
To visualize these results, Figure 1 shows mimp versus h at fixed interme-
diate temperature (βJ = 1.5), where larger k reduces the slope near h = 0
and saturation value. Figure 2 plots χ(0) versus T, illustrating exponen-
tial growth at low T but scaled down by ∼1/k. These trends underscore
how periodicity dilutes the magnetic response, interpolating toward isolated
impurities for large k.

5. Correlations
In statistical mechanics, correlation functions provide crucial insights into
the spatial organization of spins, quantifying how fluctuations at one site in-
fluence another. For the 1D Ising model, these functions are particularly
important as they reveal the absence of long-range order at finite tempera-
tures, a hallmark of one-dimensional systems with short-range interactions
[4, 3]. In our periodic impurity model, correlations acquire an additional
layer of complexity due to the modulated field, leading to exponentially de-
caying envelopes modulated by periodic prefactors. This section derives the
two-point correlation function using the transfer matrix formalism, defines
the correlation length and strengths, and discusses their physical implica-
tions. While the uniform case (k = 1) yields pure exponential decay, higher
k introduces novel oscillatory behaviors, emphasizing the role of impurity
spacing.
The two-point correlation function is defined statistically as
⟨σiσj⟩= 1

where the sum runs over all spin configurations, weighted by the Boltzmann
factor.
In the matrix formulation, this can be expressed by inserting the spin
operator S =

at the positions of the spins. Here, σi is at position
δi within the m-th unit cell, and σj is at δj within the n-th cell (n ≥m).
Thus, the numerator in the expression for the correlation is

Using the spectral decomposition of Pk,
Pk = λ+

where |R±⟩and ⟨L±| are the right and left eigenvectors, we insert this into
the trace expression. This yields four terms:
⟨σiσj⟩Z = (λ+
k )M−2⟨L+|Aδi|R+⟩⟨L+|Aδj|R+⟩

k )M−2⟨L−|Aδi|R−⟩⟨L−|Aδj|R−⟩
(26)
In the thermodynamic limit (M →∞), the terms proportional to (λ−
k /λ+

and similar vanishing ratios are neglected, leaving

the connected correlation, defining the correlation strength
Aij = ⟨L+|Aδi|R−⟩⟨L−|Aδj|R+⟩

The correlation length is then

measuring the scale over which correlations persist.
5.1. Analysis of the Correlation Length
The exponential decay of Gc(i, j) is characterized by the correlation length
ξk. From the derivation, we identify it as:
ξk =
k
ln(λ+
k /λ−
k ).
(31)
10


The behavior of ξk reveals two distinct physical regimes, as shown in Figure 3.
In the absence of an external field (h = 0), the correlation length diverges
as T →0, consistent with the system ordering into its ground state. As
temperature increases, thermal fluctuations disrupt this order, and ξk decays
monotonically. Notably, this zero-field correlation length is independent of
k.
For any non-zero field (h > 0), the behavior is different. The field creates
a spectral gap, and ξk is finite at all temperatures. At low T, the field freezes
the system, suppressing fluctuations and sending ξk →0. As T increases,
thermal energy activates fluctuations, causing ξk to grow to a maximum,
before thermal disorder dominates at high T and ξk decays again. This non-
monotonic behavior is a classic signature of a gapped 1D system. As seen in
Figure 3, this peak is more pronounced and occurs at a lower temperature
for larger k.
Figure 3: Correlation length ξk vs. Temperature (T in J/kB) for h = 0.5J. This shows
the characteristic peak for h > 0.
The field’s stiffening effect is also visible in Figure 4. At any fixed tem-
perature, increasing the field strength suppresses fluctuations, causing ξk to
decay monotonically. Interestingly, for a non-zero field, the correlation length
is larger for larger k.
11

correlations persist over longer distances for larger k.
5.2. Analysis of Correlation Strength and Anisotropy
The prefactor Aij quantifies the strength of the correlation between spe-
cific sites. From our derivation, it is defined as:
Aij = ⟨L+|Aδi|R−⟩⟨L−|Aδj|R+⟩
(λ+
k )2
.
(32)
This prefactor depends strongly on the intra-cell positions δi and δj, a phe-
nomenon known as correlation anisotropy.
The physical behavior of all prefactors, shown for k = 3 in Figure 5,
mirrors that of the correlation length. They peak at an intermediate tem-
perature, confirming that the correlation strength is maximized in the regime
where thermal fluctuations are present but not yet dominant. Similarly, all
prefactors decay monotonically as the field h increases, as the field suppresses
the fluctuations they describe. The prefactor Aij is inherently asymmetric
because the operator Aδ that measures the spin at a non-impurity site is not
symmetric.
The most important finding is the strong anisotropy. As seen in Figure 5,
the magnitudes of the prefactors vary significantly. For k = 3, the prefactors
12


|A21|, |A31|, and |A32| are clearly dominant over the "diagonal" correlations
like |A11| and |A33|.
This reveals the microscopic path of correlations: a
fluctuation at an impurity site (δ = 1) is not most strongly correlated with
the next impurity site, but rather with fluctuations at the non-field sites
immediately preceding the next impurity. This complex, non-local structure
is a direct consequence of the periodic modulation.

field strengths.
All prefactors exhibit a peak, but their magnitudes vary significantly,
demonstrating strong anisotropy.
6. Conclusion
We have presented a complete and exact solution for the one-dimensional
Ising model with a periodically applied impurity field of period k. By em-
ploying a bond-symmetric transfer matrix formalism, we derived the exact
eigenvalues and, from them, the general expressions for the system’s thermo-
dynamics and correlation functions.
13


Our analysis highlights several key physical features. The periodic im-
purity field, as a tunable parameter, systematically suppresses the system’s
overall magnetic response, as seen in both the magnetization and the zero-
field susceptibility.
The susceptibility, χk(0), scales as 1/k in the large-k
dilute limit, confirming physical intuition.
The correlation properties reveal a richer structure. We have shown that
the zero-field correlation length ξk(0) is independent of k, indicating that the
intrinsic scale of thermal fluctuations is not affected by the periodic placement
of the field sites. However, in a non-zero field, the system becomes gapped,
and ξk exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on temperature, a hallmark of
1D systems with a finite excitation gap.
Furthermore, our analysis of the correlation strength prefactors Aij demon-
strates a strong, position-dependent anisotropy. The dominant correlations
are not necessarily between the impurity sites themselves, but often involve
non-field sites, revealing a complex, non-local pathway for spin fluctuations.
This work provides a rigorous and complete benchmark solution, offering
a solid foundation for understanding the effects of periodic modulation in
low-dimensional magnetic systems.
