Abstract: Fine-pitch hybridisation processes are essential for next-generation pixel detectors and
high-density microelectronic assemblies. Conventional bump-bonding techniques, although reli-
able, remain costly and difficult to implement for single-die applications.
In this work, we present flip-chip hybridisation results combining Electroless Nickel Immersion
Gold (ENIG) bumping with Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) bonding, both developed in-house.
This method enables fine-pitch interconnections without requiring wafer-level processing.
The feasibility of the ENIG–ACF process for functional devices was demonstrated by hybri-
dising functional Timepix3 ASIC and Ti-LGAD (Trench Isolated Low-Gain Avalanche Detector)
sensors with 55 µm pitch. The approach was then extended to test structures with 25 µm pitch,
using aligned-particle ACFs. The analysis revealed that the main limitation originated from the
mismatch between ACF thickness and bump height, underlining the importance of interface geom-
etry optimisation. To address this, a dedicated simulation program was developed to model the
isotropic growth of ENIG bumps and to determine the optimum bump height as a function of ACF
thickness and pixel-matrix geometry.
The results provide valuable guidelines for future high connection density assemblies and
demonstrate the potential of the ENIG–ACF process as a scalable, low-cost alternative to conven-
tional bump-bonding techniques.

Introduction
Conventional bump-bonding techniques, although well established, rely on wafer-level processes
that are expensive and challenging to implement for single-die hybridisation. This limitation is
particularly important in research and development contexts, where chips are often produced in
small quantities, on multi-project wafers (MPWs).
To overcome these constraints, alternative
interconnection methods based on anisotropic conductive materials, and compatible with single-die
processing are being explored as part of the CERN EP R&D program on technologies for future
experiments [1] and within the AIDAinnova [2] and DRD3 [3] collaborations.
Within this framework, an innovative hybridisation approach combining Electroless Nickel
Immersion Gold (ENIG) bumping with Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) interconnection is
under development [4][5][6]. This technique aims to provide a flexible, cost-effective, and scalable
solution for fine-pitch flip-chip assemblies. The ENIG process, performed in-house, enables the
formation of metallic bumps on individual dies without the need for complex lithographic processes.
The ACF bonding uses conductive particles embedded in a thin adhesive layer to establish electrical
connections.
These two techniques, when applied together, provide a promising cost-effective
method for fine-pitch hybridisation.
This study focuses on the experimental evaluation of this ENIG-ACF hybridisation process. The
first part presents the flip-chip assembly of a functional Timepix3 ASIC and two Ti-LGAD (Trench
Isolated Low-Gain Avalanche Detector) sensors at 55 µm pitch, demonstrating the feasibility of the
method on functional devices. The second part investigates the scalability of the process down to
25 µm pitch using dedicated test structures, assessing the impact of ACF thickness, bump geometry,
and particle alignment on connection yield. Finally, a newly developed simulation program is
introduced to model ENIG-bump growth and optimise bump height with respect to ACF thickness
and chip geometry.

Fine-Pitch Hybridisation of Functional Chips Using ENIG Bumping and ACF
To evaluate the performance of the ENIG-ACF hybridisation process previously presented [4][5],
tests were done on functional chips. A Timepix3 ASIC with a 55 µm pitch and a 256 × 256 pixel
matrix was hybridised with two 64 × 64 pixels Ti-LGAD sensors (FBK–AIDAinnova production),
also featuring a 55 µm pitch. The Ti-LGAD sensors already had a 5 µm-thick, 25 µm-diameter
UBM (Under Bump Metallization) layer previously deposited on their pads. The ASIC, on the other
hand, did not have any UBM on its pads. Therefore, bumps were created on them using the ENIG
process (Fig. 1a). The bumps obtained were 6 µm high above the pad, with a diameter of 19 µm.
For the flip-chip hybridisation, an ACF of 18 µm thickness containing 3 µm-diameter nickel-
coated conductive particles (CP) with a density of 71,200 CP/mm² was used.
The ACF was
laminated on the Ti-LGAD sensors at 90 °C under a pressure of 3.2 kgf (Fig. 1b), followed by
bonding at 160 °C under 20 kgf for 2 s using a SET ACCµRA100 flip-chip bonder [7]. Two sensors
were connected side-by-side to the same ASIC. The hybrid detector obtained was then attached to a
dedicated readout PCB, and electrical connections between the hybrid and the PCB were established
by wire-bonding (Fig. 1c).

First, an electrical leakage-current measurement as function of applied bias voltage was per-
formed to verify the proper operation of the sensors. One of the two sensors showed a short circuit,
while the other displayed the expected diode-like I(V) behaviour. As the sensors had not been elec-
trically tested prior to hybridisation, it was not possible to determine whether the failure occurred
before or during the process. Therefore, subsequent characterisation focused on the functional
sensor.
To evaluate the pixel connection yield, the hybrid was exposed to a strontium-90 radioactive
beta source under a reverse bias of 100 V applied to the backside of the Ti-LGAD. The measured
leakage current was about 100 µA during the test. The resulting hit map (Fig. 2a) revealed the pixel
response. To further analyse these data, a histogram of the number of recorded hits per pixel was
plotted (Fig. 2b). Two distinct peaks were observed: the first one at lower hit counts corresponds
to pixels with a weaker response (considered not fully connected or defective), and the second one
to pixels with a strong response, interpreted as well-connected.
Based on these data, the overall connection yield was estimated to be 95 % of the 4096 pixels
(195 weakly responding pixels). Most of the weakly responding pixels formed a 2 mm × 2 mm
square at the centre of the pixel matrix (174 pixels concerned). We attribute this to the vacuum
grooves on the surface of the bonding tool used for both ACF lamination and flip-chip bonding.
These grooves caused a local accumulation of ACF material during lamination, leading to poor
connections for pixels located in those regions (Fig. 1c). Excluding the pixels affected by this
lamination issue, 99.5 % of the remaining pixels were well connected (21 pixels outside the groove-
regions are weakly responding). Future tests using a bonding tool without grooves are therefore
expected to achieve connection yields close to 99 % under the same process conditions.
In conclusion, this hybridisation test shows the feasibility of hybridising 3.5 × 3.5 mm² pixel
matrices with a 55 µm pitch using ACF technology combined with ENIG bumping. However, the
lamination step should be improved by using an adapted tool.

25 µm Pitch Hybridisation Using ACF and ENIG Bumping
To assess the compatibility of the ENIG and ACF-based hybridisation process with chips featuring
pitches below 55 µm, experiments were carried out on custom-designed interconnect-test chips with
25 µm pitch [8]. The chip dimensions are 5 mm × 4.7 mm with a matrix size of 128 × 128 aluminium
pads (Fig. 3a). These test structures are made of quartz (transparent), allowing visual confirmation
of alignment and evaluation of ACF particle density. Daisy-chain structures are implemented on
them, allowing evaluation of the interconnection yield by measuring the resistance of the electrical
chains after flip-chip bonding.
First, ENIG bumps were realised on the chips using the in-house ENIG process. The bump
height obtained was 4.5 µm ± 0.2 µm on both chips (Fig. 3b).
The flip-chip process was then performed as follows: first, an anisotropic conductive film was
laminated at 80 °C under a force of 1 kgf on one of the two chips (Fig. 3c). The ACF used has a
thickness of 18 µm and contains nickel-coated conductive particles with a diameter of 3.2 µm and
a density of 28,000 CP/mm². Unlike the ACFs typically used in our previous tests, this material
featured aligned conductive particles. The pitch of the particles position is about 6.4 µm in a
triangular matrix shape. The main advantage of the aligned particles in the ACF is that it increases
the connection probability in small-pitch and small-pad configurations, compared to ACFs with
randomly distributed particles, which often exhibit particle clustering and void formation (areas
without particles).
The flip-chip bonding of the two test chips was performed at 150 °C during few seconds, under
a force of 15 kgf, resulting in a mechanically stable assembly. Electrical continuity tests could not
be performed, since the probing lines on the test chips were damaged due to fabrication issues.
Therefore, another method was employed to assess the connection yield: the chips were separated,
and the bonding interface was inspected to evaluate the percentage of bumps on which at least one
conductive particle had been smashed, indicating a connection after flip-chip bonding (Fig. 4a).
Chip separation was performed using a pull tester, and a force of 11.4 N (corresponding to
7.2 kgf/cm² for this assembly) was needed to detach the ACF. Based on SEM characterisations, a
connectivity yield of ≈90 % was estimated, which illustrates the potential of the ACF interconnect
method for such fine-pitch applications.

Investigations were conducted to understand how the connection yield could be improved.
Inspection revealed that, after lamination, conductive particles were uniformly distributed across all
the surface of the chip as expected (Fig. 3c). However, post-bonding analysis indicated significant
particle misalignment, with some regions exhibiting voids and others clusters of particles (Fig. 4b).
This behaviour is attributed to the large thickness of the ACF film (18 µm), which is not suitable
for fine-pitch bumps with a height of 4.5 µm. During the flip-chip bonding step, the excess ACF
volume was displaced laterally toward the edges of the assembly, resulting in particle displacement
and misalignment (Fig. 4c).
In conclusion, this test represents our first attempt at connecting 25 µm-pitch test structures
using ENIG bumping and ACF bonding, and the estimated connection yield is ≈90 %. The results
highlight the importance of matching the ACF thickness to the bump geometry and suggest that
thinner ACF films, specifically designed for fine-pitch assemblies, can enable higher interconnection
yields in future iterations.

Development of a Program to Optimise ENIG Bump Height
To improve the connection yield, an optimisation of the bump height with respect to the ACF
thickness is required, taking into account the pitch and pad dimensions of the chips. As shown
above, a too large ACF thickness compared to the combined height of the bumps on both chips to be
hybridised leads to the excess ACF volume being squeezed out of the pixel-matrix area during the
flip-chip bonding process. On the other hand, since the ENIG bump growth is isotropic, excessively
large bumps reduce the inter-bump volume, thereby limiting the space available for the ACF between
adjacent bumps. Consequently, the bump height must be carefully adjusted to the ACF thickness,
in order to achieve optimal mechanical bonding and high electrical connection yield.
To address this, a dedicated simulation tool was developed to model the isotropic growth of
ENIG bumps using analytical geometric equations and determine the optimum bump height based
on chip parameters such as pad opening diameter, pitch, pattern of the pitch (triangular or square).
Each ENIG bump is represented as a truncated dome with a flat top matching the pad diameter and
curved sides representing isotropic growth. The simulator arranges the pads in either a square or
triangular matrix according to user-defined rows, columns, and pitch. This tool was implemented
in Python, using NumPy for numerical computation and Matplotlib for data visualization (2D and
3D plots). The program provides 3D visualisations of the simulated matrices (Fig. 5a), as well as
plots showing the evolution of the free volume between bumps and the maximum compatible ACF
thickness as a function of bump height (Fig. 5b). This tool will provide guidance for adapting the
ENIG bump height to the ACF thickness, thereby improving future hybridisation processes.

Conclusion and Outlook
This study presents results of ENIG–ACF flip-chip hybridisation for fine-pitch (55 µm and 25 µm)
interconnections. The hybridisation of functional Timepix3 and Ti-LGAD sensors confirmed the
process feasibility on functional components, achieving connection yields of 95% with prospect
for improvement. The hybridisation of 25 µm pitch interconnect test structures further extended
the approach towards higher interconnect density, with a ≈90 % connectivity yield estimated.

The results highlight the importance of matching the ACF thickness with the bump height for
achieving optimal electrical and mechanical bonding.
Excessive ACF thickness was shown to
induce particle displacement, reducing the effective connection yield. To mitigate this, a dedicated
ENIG bump-height optimisation tool was developed, enabling predictive adjustment of bump
geometry based on chip characteristics and ACF parameters. Future work will focus on further
optimising these processes to enhance connection yield, particularly for chips with pitches down to
25 µm. In addition, the impact of thermal cycling and irradiation on interconnect reliability will
be investigated, with the goal of adapting this hybridisation method to the specific requirements of
next-generation particle-physics detectors.
