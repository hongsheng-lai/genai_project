Abstract
This article proposed the optimization problem formulation to find optimal sizes of Photovoltaics (PV) and Battery Energy
Storage Systems (BESS) for individual participants within the context of the Renewable Energy Community (REC). An
optimization problem considered the dynamic nature of electricity pricing, solar irradiation levels, financial aspects such as
capital investment, and operational and maintenance expenditures of PV and BESS. The analysis also considered replacement
costs and the efficiency of charging and discharging the BESS unit. We employed Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming
(MINLP) to find the optimal system size to maximize individual participants’ Net Present Value (NPV). Furthermore, in
this study, we used daily representative signals for each season of the year to reduce simulation runtime. The Fast Iterative
Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) was used to extract these signals. Then these representative signals obtained were
used in the optimization problem formulation to reduce simulation time and extend our analysis to a wider planning horizon.
In addition, the study introduced fairness by applying the individual marginal contribution method to distribute incentives
equitably among REC participants, ensuring that each member benefited from their contribution. A simulation study was
performed using a real demand dataset of five houses located in Roseto Valfortore, a small town and commune of the Foggia
Province in the Apulia region of southern Italy, as a proof of the practical relevance and usefulness of the ideas discussed.
Ultimately, the goal of the article was to empower the REC with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions and
shape the future of sustainable energy.

Introduction
T
he
landscape
of
renewable
energy
generation
transformed,
reflecting
the
new
policies
that
shaped our power networks. In this era of deregulation,
more people and companies became involved in the
management of energy resources. An example of this
shift was the increasing number of RECs. A REC
was a localized group of individuals, businesses, or
organizations that collaborated in the generation,
distribution, and consumption of renewable energy
resources. These communities were characterized by
their commitment to sustainable energy practices, with
the aim of reducing the reliance on nonrenewable energy
sources and minimizing environmental impacts. The
key features of an REC included collective ownership
or shared access to renewable energy infrastructure,

such as solar panels and energy storage technologies.
REC participants worked together to exploit natural
resources
in
an
environmentally
friendly
manner,
fostering a sense of shared responsibility for energy
production and consumption [1]. People joined a
REC because of the opportunity for real economic
advantages, primarily through lower energy bills [2].
The reduced energy costs and the option to sell
extra energy to the grid at reasonable rates added to
the savings compared to regular rates. Furthermore,
the public authority provided an additional reward
for sharing energy within the REC, making it even
more appealing to REC members [3]. This modern
concept of the REC was supported by a regulatory
framework that allowed participants (at least two)
to create fair contracts to share distributed energy
resources [4]. Within this innovative framework, the
REC brought three main benefits. First, it achieved
substantial environmental gains, notably in the form
of a reduced carbon footprint. Second, it fosters social
empowerment by encouraging increased participation

from end users, thereby nurturing a sense of community
and shared purpose in energy production. Lastly, REC’s
energy-sharing practices yielded considerable economic
benefits, manifested as revenue streams generated
through
collaborative
energy
transactions
between
its members. For these benefits, it was essential to
implement intelligent control algorithms and advanced
communication technologies that ensured the stable
and reliable operation of individual REC units and
facilitated potential interactions with external entities,
such as aggregators, transmission system operators
(TSO), and public authorities.
The control algorithms used in the REC had to align
with the rules and regulations provided by the public
authority, the preferences of the participants, and the
specific operational limits of the REC. Finding the
optimal size of the system components in advance
was crucial for making the REC profitable, especially
when considering how many PV and BESS components
were needed. Some earlier studies examined the sizing
problems in peer-to-peer energy sharing but did not
explicitly consider the revenue earned through energy
sharing or the potential savings on transmission costs.
For example, a study examined the optimal sizing of
solar PV, BESS and diesel generators in [5], while
another explored the appropriate sizes for PV, wind
and BESS using forecasted power generation data in
[6]. Furthermore, [7] solved an optimization problem
with respect to the sizes of solar PV and BESS
installations using data from 300 Australian households.
Articles [8] and [9] introduced a model to decide
the optimal number of solar PV and BESS units for
residential systems, considering uncertainties in solar
generation, load demand, and different pricing schemes.
Solar
PV
and
BESS
served
various
applications,
including peer-to-peer energy trading [10], demand side
management [11], and minimizing electricity bills [12].
In [13], the authors highlighted various key performance
indicators and considered the optimal size of the system
from an economic perspective. In [14] and [15], a
two-stage approach and energy management of electrical
equipment were explained. However, articles focusing on
the REC lacked information on the optimal sizing of PV
and BESS for individual participants. In particular, [16]
suggested a model for optimal system size to maximize
community revenue, and [17] introduced a framework
for fair revenue sharing and exit clauses among REC
participants, considering the optimal size of solar PV
and BESS. The concept of a bilevel model for an internal
local market within the REC was explained in [18],
which demonstrated a fair revenue distribution among
its members. In addition, some studies considered
sizing problems while accounting for the capacity of the
distribution network line [19] and the transformer rating
[20]. In particular, [21] proposed a MINLP scheme for
optimal solar PV and BESS sizing, and in [22], a bilevel
optimization model was used to determine parameters
and profiles for new REC participants, considering
existing community members. In energy trading, [23]
explored energy purchase and bid strategies for energy
exchange within and between REC communities.
Although
many
aspects
were
well
explored,
the
challenges of optimal system sizing for individual
participants needed further investigation to enhance
REC’s overall efficiency and effectiveness. Although
previous studies addressed sizing issues in RECs, a
critical gap existed as they overlooked NPV a crucial
factor
and
confined
their
investigations
to
single
day profiles, neglecting the longer planning horizon
(typically 20 to 25 years). It was imperative to recognize
that seasonal variations and uncertainties in energy
demand and renewable generation over decades further
complicated sizing decisions, necessitating a robust
framework that balanced technical feasibility with
long-term economic viability. In response to these
challenges, this paper presented an innovative approach
to optimal sizing of PV and BESS for individual REC
participants. Our methodology leveraged representative
daily periodic signals of four seasons, spring, summer,
fall and winter, blending the dynamic nature of
renewable energy sources with the crucial concept
of NPV considering the timing of future cash flows.
Furthermore, we proposed the individual marginal
contribution as a fair and computationally efficient
method to allocate costs and benefits proportionally,
thus fostering collaboration and stability within the
REC. We examined these mechanisms through a
numerical study that revealed their characteristics and
effectiveness in promoting fairness within the REC. This
article aimed to fill critical gaps in existing research by
providing information on the optimal sizing of PV and
BESS for individual REC participants.
The remainder of the paper was structured as follows.
Section II described the mathematical model of the
system components; in Section III, we formulate the
optimal sizing problem followed by its approximation
using the “periodic signal”; Section IV demonstrated
the simulation results; and Section V presented the
conclusions.

Mathematical Modeling
As shown in Fig. 1, we considered a scenario in
which n participants and the Technical Facilitator
(TF) formed a REC. All participants were equipped
with smart meters to facilitate informed decision
making by providing real-time information on energy
production and consumption. A dedicated TF was
an essential entity within the REC to ensure smooth
operation and provide technical support to individual
participants. The TF played an important role in
providing information on the latest technologies, sharing
best practices, connecting with resources, and helping
navigate technical and regulatory challenges that arose
2


in developing the REC. The TF came from government
agencies, nonprofit organizations, or private companies,
acting as an essential guide on the journey of building
an REC.
The proposed REC model delegated all responsibilities,
including design, operation, maintenance, and energy
management, to the TF, as mutually decided by all
participants. The REC system was monitored and
operated under the terms and rewards of the service
agreement with the TF. Compensation for TF was
specified as a portion of the financial gain obtained
by REC participants. On the benefit side, community
participants received incentives for sharing energy,
reduced electricity bills, and other indirect benefits, such
as lower carbon emissions. Following internal regulations
and the signed contract, the TF retained a specified
amount and the remaining funds were distributed
fairly among all participants. Typically, within this
framework, the TF made two contracts with the REC
participants: (1) a real-time energy management system
contract covering the deployment and management of
installed solar PV and BESS, and (2) a maintenance and
operation costs contract covering the related expenses
for each participant based on the number of solar PV
and BESS installed.
In addition, each participant maintained a physical
connection to the Point of Common Coupling (PCC),
which
formed
the
energy
exchange
network.
An
individual solar PV captured sunlight and converted it
into usable electrical power. This energy played multiple
roles within the community: it fulfilled local energy
needs, recharged the BESS, sold back to the main
grid, and shared within the REC. The transaction was
divided into four categories: (1) self-consumed: Each
participant leveraged their locally generated solar power
to meet their electricity demand and charge the BESS,
ensuring efficient self-reliance; (2) energy sold: after
self-consumption, any remaining surplus energy was
sold to the main grid, contributing to the participants’
revenue; (3) energy sharing: all participants met their
electricity demand from the solar energy generated
within the REC (with a portion of the sold energy
constituting the shared energy); and (4) energy bought:
participants purchased deficit energy from the main
grid during periods of reduced solar generation. In this
context, participants were motivated to meet their REC
energy demand from locally generated power due to cost
savings compared to regular grid prices and incentives
received from the public authority.
The detailed discussion and mathematical modeling of
different elements of the REC, such as PV energy, BESS,
grid, and NPV, are further elaborated. In the following
subsections, we describe the mathematical modeling of
various REC elements. In this regard, R+, N and ⌊·⌋
denote the set of nonnegative real numbers, the set of
natural numbers, and the floor operator, respectively;
Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the REC. In this model,
the TF signs a contract with all the participants. This
contract covers the real energy management, as well as the
operation and maintenance costs for the solar PV and BESS
installed on each participant’s rooftop.
let Y be the set of years in the planning horizon and
t ∈Ty denote a generic time instant corresponding to
year y ∈Y. Unless otherwise stated, the formulas apply
∀t ∈Ty and ∀y ∈Y.
2.1
PV
PV energy enabled the REC to become a self-sufficient
energy generator, reducing the dependence on the
main grid. Solar PV offered various benefits beyond
its substantial economic advantage, such as playing a
crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
environmental pollution and contributing to a cleaner,
more sustainable future. Their presence improved
energy security, acting as a valuable power source
during power outages. In addition, governments often
provided financial incentives or subsidies to improve
the affordability of solar PV. For the mathematical
modeling, the power generation of a single panel was
modeled as per [25] and was defined as:
ˆP s
t = P r Et
ˆE

1 −
γ
100(θc
t −ˆθ)

,
(1)
where Et, γ, P r and θc
t
respectively denoted the
irradiance level, the power temperature coefficient,
the rated capacity of a single panel, and the cell
temperature. In addition, ˆE and ˆθ were the irradiance
and temperature under standard test conditions. Here,
the coefficient γ was important because it showed how
changes in cell or surface temperature affected the power
output of solar PVs. In particular, the specific value of
γ depended on the type of solar PV system employed,
whether it was polycrystalline, monocrystalline, thin
film, or another variant. This model facilitated a
3


deep understanding of the dynamics that underlay
solar power generation and its response to varying
environmental conditions. As proposed in [25], the cell
temperature of solar PV systems (θc
t) was expressed
using the following equation:
θc
t = θa
t + Et
ˆE
(θ −ˆθ),
(2)
where θ was the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature
(NOCT),
defined
as
the
temperature
reached
by
open-circuited cells in a module under the conditions:
(1) Irradiance on cell surface = 0.8 kW/m2; (2) Air
Temperature = 20◦C; and (3) Wind Velocity = 1 m/s.
However, it was important to note that since the solar
generation determined by (1) applied only to a single
PV panel, the nth participant had to install a variable
number of PV panels, denoted as N p,n, to fulfill their
energy requirements. The total solar power generation,
taking into account N p,n panels, was defined as:
P s,n
t
= N p,n ˆP s
t .
(3)
Moreover, there was also a constraint on the available
area for installing solar PV panels. Proper installation
demanded a specific amount of space to maximize
solar irradiation. This space was often limited in urban
environments due to structures like buildings and trees
obstructing sunlight. As such, the installation of Np,n
solar panels was bounded by the following constraint:
0 ≤N p,n ≤
An
Ap

.
(4)
In this equation, An and Ap denoted the available space
for the nth participant’s PV system installation and the
area occupied by a single panel, respectively. As the
number of solar panels N p,n had to be a whole number,
the floor function (⌊⌋) was employed in the computation.
In the quest to install these solar panels, each participant
procured panels of size P r at a cost of ˆCp. The total cost
for the nth participant’s solar panels was calculated as
follows:
Cp,n = ˆCpN p,n.
(5)
Additionally, individual participants within the REC
paid the Operating and Maintenance Costs (OPEXp)
along with the Contract Agreement Costs (CAp)
associated with solar PV. This combined cost, denoted
as OMCAp,n, was computed as follows:
OMCAp,n = N p,nOPEXp + N p,nCAp.
(6)
For
simplicity,
the
installation
assumed
that
all
participants used the same type of PVs.
2.2
BESS
The BESS was a valuable asset for all REC participants,
allowing them to save substantially on their electricity
bills. This was made possible by optimally capturing
locally generated energy during high-demand periods
with high electricity rates. Later, this stored energy was
used to meet demand when it was most cost-effective.
In addition, the BESS served as a reliable backup power
source during unexpected outages, adding additional
resilience to the REC. The state of charge of a single
BESS was modeled using the energy-reservoir model [5],
which was characterized by charging and discharging
efficiencies:
ˆSt+∆t = ˆSt +

where 0 ≤

d were the
bounded charging and discharging power, and ηc and
ηd respectively denoted the charging and discharging
efficiencies of the BESS. As the capacity of the BESS
was finite, the state of charge was also bounded, i.e.,
S ≤ˆSt ≤S,
(8)
where S and S were the minimum and maximum
states of charge of the BESS. Let P c,n
t
and P d,n
t
denote
the aggregate charging and discharging power for the
nth participant associated with the number of BESS
installed, i.e., N b,n, such that

and bd,n

were binary variables imposed to

(10)
Accordingly, (8) was modified as

where

(12)
Let us introduce ˆCb as the cost of a BESS with a capacity
of B. Consequently, the total expenditure for procuring
N b,n BESS units for each nth participant was calculated
as per the following equation:
Cb,n = ˆCbN b,n.
(13)
4


The decision variable of the BESS units, represented
by N b,n, also had to adhere to an upper limit, denoted
N
b, to suit the specific requirements of the systems.
Consequently, the imposed constraint was defined as
follows:
0 ≤N b,n ≤N
b.
(14)
Additionally, individual participants within the REC
were responsible for covering Operating and Maintenance
Costs (OPEXb) along with Contract Agreement Costs
(CAb) associated with their BESS units. This collective
cost, denoted as OMCAb,n, was computed as follows:
OMCAb,n = N b,nOPEXb + N b,nCAb.
(15)
To streamline the analysis, it was assumed that all
participants in REC used the same type of BESS.
2.3
Power Flows
In our considered REC setup illustrated in Figure 1,
P sell,n
t
denoted the surplus power sold to the grid by the
nth participant at time t, P sh,n
t
was the power shared
by the nth participant with other members of the REC
at time t (treated as a virtual quantity), P c,n
t
and P d,n
t
represented the charging and discharging power of the
BESS belonging to participant n at time t, and P self,n
t
was the power that participant n consumed from their
own renewable source at time t. The power balance
constraints, as defined in (16), ensured that the power
supply consistently met the demands of the participants
at all times.

nth participant at time t. Furthermore, P self,n
t
denoted
the power that the nth participant consumed from their
own renewable resources. All these power flows had to
be positive to ensure that our optimization model was
realistic. Therefore, we imposed the following constraint:
P sell,n
t

t , P self,n
t
≥0.
(17)
This constraint guaranteed that there were no negative
power values, which helped maintain a clear and feasible
energy management model.
2.4
Electricity Rate
An electricity rate, a pivotal factor in the sector of
energy economics, played a dual role in determining the
financial dynamics of participants within the electricity
market. It was both the cost borne by participants
for their consumption and the revenue they earned
when selling surplus electricity back to the grid. The
electricity providers decided on this rate, which was
subject to various variables that contributed to its
fluctuation. Factors such as time of day, the prevailing
season, and overall electricity demand influenced the
changes in electricity rates. Typically, prices peaked
during the summer, when the overall demand for
electricity increased. This occurred because of the
necessity of incorporating more expensive generation
sources to cope with the increased energy requirements
during that period. It was essential to recognize that the
participants’ purchase price was higher than the selling
price, reflecting the higher distribution costs incurred
in delivering electricity to end consumers [31].
As shown in Figure 2, and focusing on the specific
context of Italy, the daily electricity price was divided
into three distinct bands. F1, F2, and F3. Here, F1
covered peak hours from Monday to Friday between 9
and 19, with the highest rates due to increased demand
and the use of more expensive generation sources. F2
included shoulder hours, covering the morning and
evening periods on weekdays, 8 and 20 to 23 and
Saturdays, 8 to 23, with rates lower than F1 but slightly
higher than F3. Lastly, F3 represented off-peak hours,
primarily during the night on weekdays from 24 to 7 and
throughout the day on Sundays from 1 to 24, with the
lowest electricity rates. Additional details on different
costs, revenue, and incentives for the considered REC
systems were further explained.
Fig. 2. Italian grid electricity rate structure.
Let us consider that the power P sell,n
t
was sold to the
grid by the nth participant at a price CS
t ∈R+; then
the total revenue for power selling to the grid for the nth
5


participant was denoted as
Rsell,n =
X
t∈T
CS
t P sell,n
t
∆t.
(18)
As collective solar generation P s,n
t
served the dual role
of meeting the local load demand dn
t and supplying
power P c,n
t
for the charging of the BESS, it entailed
financial benefits for individual participants. This
dual functionality translated into savings as they
offset their electricity costs at the prevailing price
CP
t . Consequently, the total savings attributed to
self-consumed
power
for
the
nth
participant
was
expressed as follows:
Rself,n =
X
t∈T
CP
t P self,n
t
∆t.
(19)
In instances where a participant found themselves with
surplus solar generation, they engaged in energy sharing,
thereby establishing a mutually beneficial transaction
with another REC participant. This exchange occurred
at a specified rate, denoted as CE
t . It should be noted
that this rate of sharing energy, CE
t , was greater than
the rate at which excess energy was sold to the grid, CS
t .
This distinctive pricing structure yielded an additional
revenue stream for the REC participant and actively
encouraged the use of locally generated solar power.
Furthermore, when energy was consumed within the
REC, it conferred the advantage of economizing on
transmission power costs, marked by the rate CT
t ,
another benefit provided by the public authority. This
dual advantage further contributed to the growing
popularity
of
REC
development.
The
combined
incentive for the nth participant was summarized as
follows:
Ish =
X
t∈T
(CE
t + CT
t )P sh
t ∆t.
(20)
2.5
NPV
The NPV was the sum of the present value of future
cash flows (CF) for the accounting period associated
with the investment, and it was discounted so that it
was expressed in today’s worth of money [33]. In other
words, the money earned in the future was considered
less valuable at the initial time of investment. That is,
by denoting the cash flows at year y as CFy and the
discount rate as r, the generic NPV for any system was
written as follows:
NPV = −INV +
X
y∈Y
CFy
(1 + r)y ,
(21)
where INV was the total investment cost. In the
presented
modeling,
NPV
was
calculated
for
the
individual participants of the REC. For the calculation,
the incentive on sharing power within the REC Ish,
revenue for selling power to the grid Rsell,n, and savings
on self-consumption Rsav,n were used to estimate the
future CF of each year y associated with the initial
time of investment. Then, the cumulative computation
of NPV was performed by adding up each year’s CF
over the entire planning horizon. From (6), (15), (18)
and (21), the total NPV for the mth year was estimated
using the formula:
NPVn
m =
m
X
y=0
−INVn
y + Rsell,n
y
+ Rself,n
y
+ ζnIsh
y
−OMCAp,n −OMCAb,n
(1 + r)y

(22)
where ζn was the distribution factor of individual
participants, which was obtained using the formula
derived in (38). Also, INVn
y denoted the investment
by the nth participant corresponding to the yth year,
defined as

(23)
The payback period for the nth
participant was
calculated based on (22), which provided information
about the duration of the time period in which the
investment money was recovered by selling energy to
the grid, receiving incentives on energy sharing, and
saving on self-consumption. It was written using the
following equation:
PBn = min{m | NPVn
m ≥0, ∀m ∈[m, |Y|]},
(24)
where the cardinality of Y, denoted as |Y|, was the
length of the planning horizon, which included all the
periods considered for the investment evaluation. It was
often used as a simple way to evaluate the profitability
and risk of an investment. After the payback period,
the investment continued to generate cash flow for the
remainder of the lifespan of the PV-BESS systems, which
was considered income generated by the investment.
Finally, the net profit (NP) of the entire REC was
calculated based on the following equation:
NP =
X
n∈N
NPVn
|Y|,
(25)
where the NP comprised all future cash flows discounted
back to their present value, thus providing a comprehensive
measure of the financial performance of the REC
investment over its lifespan.

Optimal Sizing Problem Formulation
For the considered REC systems, an optimization
problem was formulated to find the optimal number of
6


solar PV and BESS for individual participants in the
REC, which involved the maximization of NP while
meeting a set of constraints. The constraints included
factors such as total power exchange with the grid, the
maximum power output of the PV panels and BESS,
the capacity of the BESS, and other design constraints.
For the considered REC system with N participants, the
optimization problem was formulated as follows:

variables and Ty := {1, 2, . . . , Ty}, ∀y ∈Y was the
planning horizon. The yearly horizon was typically the
same for all years, that is, Ty = ¯T, ∀y ∈Y.
Remark 1 We aim to maximize NP by finding the
optimal value of each variable that produced the highest
output value. Solving (26) for a planning horizon of the
order of decades was computationally very heavy due
to the increase in the number of decision variables and
constraints that had to be satisfied at each time instant.
As an alternative to this, we proposed to take advantage
of the periodicity of solar generation and the demand
profile, as described in the following subsection.
3.1
Exploiting Periodicity
Solar power generation and demand profiles in a house
had inherent periodicities that were used to reduce the
dimensionality of the optimal sizing problem and the
execution runtime. Although the periodicity could have
been daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, for simplicity
the daily periodic signal was used for the analysis since
it covered all working hours of the day. In parallel
to leveraging daily periodicity, the electricity demand
profiles for REC participants were preprocessed using
logarithmic transformation and detrending to capture
their multi-seasonal characteristics [28], [29]. More
precisely, the following model for the load (electricity
demand) L(t) was assumed:
L(t) = exp

T(t) + F(t) +
X
i
Hi(t) + e(t)

(27)
where T(t) denoted the trend, F(t) was the deterministic
multi-seasonal component including daily, weekly, and
yearly periodicities, Hi(t) were the intervention events
accounting for the effect of holidays, and e(t) was an
error term. Following [30], the trend T(t) was estimated
as the output of a lowpass filter with bandwidth

y(t) = ln(L(t)) −T(t) = F(t) +
X
i
Hi(t) + e(t) (28)
exhibited a relatively stable profile, whose variability
was mostly due to the simultaneous presence of daily,
weekly, and yearly seasonalities. To calculate the
multi-seasonal component F(t), a Fourier expansion for
weekly and yearly periodic signals was used as
Fy(t) = a0 +

An interaction between weekly and yearly periodic
signals was taken into account for the calculation of the
final multi-seasonal component F(t) using the equation
F(t) =

i=1
θihi(t),
hi(t) ∈Y ⊗W,

where Y = {cos(jΨt), j ∈[0, Ny]} ∪{sin(jΨt), j ∈
[1, Ny]} and W = {cos(kΩt), k ∈[0, Nw]} ∪{sin(kΩt),
k ∈[1, Nw −1]}. Here, Ny and Nw were the numbers
of yearly and weekly harmonics, respectively. These
selected numbers of harmonics allowed the model to
capture variations associated with different times of the
week, reflecting weekly cycles within the larger yearly
cycle. Let θ ∈Rn denote the vector that contained the
coefficients of the Fourier expansion of F(t). Then,
Y = Φθ + ε,
(31)
where Y
=
[y(1) y(2) . . . y(n)]T
was the vector of
log-transformed and detrended loads, and the columns
ϕi of Φ ∈Rn×m were the sampled regressors, i.e.,
ϕi = [hi(1) hi(2) . . . hi(n)]T . For the model in (31) with
Y ∈Rn×1, Φ ∈Rn×m, θ ∈Rm×1 and ε as a noise term,
the LASSO regularized estimate [34] was defined as:
θLASSO = arg min

(32)
where the balance between the loss function and
the regularization term was controlled by the scalar
regularization parameter λ. To solve (32), the FISTA
method [32] was used, as described in Algorithm 1.

In our study, a yearly pattern of electricity usage was
analyzed to explore its daily trends. A typical signal
spanned one year was extracted using the FISTA
method and a single day from each season of the year was
selected. From these four representative daily signals,
denoted as x, the NPV was recalculated as

denoted the revenue for selling power to the grid,
the savings on self-consumption, and the incentive on

approximate annual income and costs, the sum was
multiplied by β = 91, which was the total number of
days in a season. From (34), the NP of the entire REC

Individual Marginal Contribution
This method calculated the marginal contribution
of each participant based on their individual energy
sharing profile, which quantified the unique contribution
of each participant. For individual contribution, it was
necessary to find the total incentive received from the

which were expressed as

simulation was an Intel Core i7-11800H, 2.3GHz server
with 32GB of RAM. The developed REC model was
applied to a real case study to test its practical use and
evaluate its potential. The case study was related to the
low voltage grid in Roseto Valfortore, a small town and
commune in the Foggia province in the Apulia region
of southeastern Italy. For the simulation analysis, five
household demand profiles of participants from the
Roseto Valfortore energy community were collected,
and historical solar irradiance and temperature data for
the town of Roseto Valfortore were obtained from the
online monitoring dashboard [24], with the sampling
rate ∆t = 1 h. Furthermore, the solar PV panel and
BESS specifications were provided in Table 1, which
were taken from [26] and [27], respectively. Furthermore,
the electricity purchase rate CP
t for blocks F1, F2, and
F3 was taken to be 0.195, 0.165 and 0.125 e/ kWh,
respectively. At the same time, the sale electricity rate
CS
t for blocks F1, F2 and F3 was set to 0.075, 0.055
and 0.035 e/ kWh, respectively. Furthermore, it was
considered that the electricity sharing rate CE
t and the
electricity transmission rate CT
t were 0.11 e/ kWh and
0.00822 e/ kWh, respectively. The simulation study
assumed that: (1) the daily load profile of all participants
was known; (2) the irradiance profile of the geographical
location was known; and (3) the distribution network
transmission line was considered ideal, i.e. no constraints
were imposed on the network transmission line.

As shown in Fig. 3(a), the NPV of individual participants
was
recovered
within
the
payback
period,
which
depended on the duration for which the participants
wanted to recover their investment cost. It also suggested
that investing in the REC was financially advantageous
in the long run. Another observation was that the first
and third participants replaced their BESS after 12
years, and therefore the graph showed a slight decline
followed by an increase again because of the revenue
generation and incentives from shared energy within
the REC. Fig. 3(b) compared the electricity bills of
the participants before and after joining the REC and
showed that all participants reduced their electricity
costs by becoming part of the community. Fig. 3(c)
showed that the incentive for each participant was based
on the amount of energy they contributed to the shared
energy, highlighting the direct rewards for active energy
sharing. Finally, Fig. 3(d) presented the total shared
energy profiles for four representative days (one for each
season), illustrating how the share of energy varied and
highlighting seasonal differences.
Fig. 4 provided a detailed look at how five participants
in the REC managed their electricity consumption,
solar generation, and potential battery storage. Each
row corresponded to one participant and the three
columns (a), (b), and (c) highlighted key aspects of their
energy flow. In Fig. 4(a), the light blue area showed the
participant’s electricity demand, while the light orange
area represented their solar generation. The vertical
stem line on top of the demand curve indicated the
portion of electricity directly self-consumed from solar,
illustrating how much of their demand was met by their
generation in real-time. Focusing on each participant,
it was observed that self-consumption (P self
t
) varied
throughout the day as solar production (P s
t ) fluctuated.
During peak sunlight hours, the stem line that indicated
self-consumption (P self
t
) often matched a significant
portion of the participant’s demand (light blue area),
thereby reducing the dependence on the grid. Solar
generation (light orange area) sometimes exceeded the
demand curve, hinting at surplus electricity that could
potentially be stored or sold to the grid. The degree of
overlap between solar generation and demand was an
essential indicator of how effectively participants used
their renewable resources.
Fig. 4(b) showed the charging behavior (P c
t ) and the
discharging behavior (P d
t ) of the BESS. For participants
who did not have a BESS installed, these plots remained
at zero, reflecting no BESS activity. For those with a
BESS, the positive values represented battery charging
(using excess solar energy), while the negative values

corresponded to discharge (supplying the participant’s
demand when solar production was insufficient or during
periods of high grid cost). This battery operation allowed
participants to optimize their solar use by storing energy
for later consumption, thus increasing self-consumption
and reducing peak grid demand. In Fig. 4(c), the
10


surplus power sold to the grid by each participant is
depicted. When solar generation exceeded self-demand
and battery charging needs, excess electricity was
sold back to the grid. Participants without a BESS
often showed more frequent or higher spikes in grid
export during sunny periods because they had no
means of storing surplus energy, while participants with
batteries exported less at noon since they first charged
their storage and then sold power to the grid once
the battery was full or when it became economically
optimal to discharge. These results showed that the
REC participants used different strategies. Those with
BESS and PV reduced their reliance on the grid and
improved their financial returns. Even participants
without BESS benefited by using solar power to reduce
their dependence on the grid and by selling extra power
back to the grid. In general, the results proved that
the coordinated smart control strategy improved the
economic and environmental performance of the REC.

Conclusion
This article proposed the optimal sizing formulation
for individual REC participants using MINLP. Since
simulation for a longer planning horizon was ineffective
in solving, daily representative signals were used for
each season of the year to determine the optimal number
of solar PV and BESS with the objective of maximizing
NP for individual REC participants. The FISTA
algorithm was used to obtain these daily representative
signals. Moreover, after receiving payment from the
TF via the public authority, the fair revenue-sharing
mechanism was proposed using the individual marginal
contribution method. The simulation results showed
that the participant received an additional incentive to
participate in the REC. This incentive for individual
participants was determined after making payment to
the TF for real-time energy management, operation,
and maintenance costs for installed solar PV and
BESS. These findings highlighted the potential of a
collaborative energy community to support the adoption
of renewable energy while ensuring fairness for all
participants. This work offered a clear and practical
roadmap for creating an efficient, sustainable, and fair
REC. In the future, this research could have been
explored by applying this model in different settings
and with other renewable energy sources.
