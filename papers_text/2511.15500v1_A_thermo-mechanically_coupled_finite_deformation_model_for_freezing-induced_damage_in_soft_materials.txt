Abstract
In the U.S., approximately 17 patients die each day awaiting an organ transplant, a crisis driven by the
inability to store organs long-term via methods like cryopreservation. A primary failure mechanism is the
severe thermo-mechanical damage tissues experience during freezing. A predictive understanding of this
damage is hindered by the complex interplay between heat transfer, phase change, and large deformation
mechanics. Motivated by this fundamental problem, we present a fully coupled, thermo-mechanical phase-
field framework for modeling damage evolution in fluid-saturated soft materials under cryogenic conditions.
The theoretical framework integrates heat transfer with solid-liquid phase transition, finite deformation
nonlinear elasticity, and progressive mechanical damage. The governing equations are solved using FEniCS
finite element package. The presentation will detail the theoretical framework and showcase representative
simulations that capture the spatiotemporal evolution of temperature, freezing phase field, stress, and dam-
age fields during representative freezing protocols. The developed framework serves as a powerful tool for
understanding the fundamental mechanisms of freezing-induced injury and for designing improved cryop-
reservation strategies.

1. Introduction
Cryopreservation—the use of ultra-low temperatures to preserve biological tissues and organs—holds im-
mense promise for extending organ transplantation windows, enabling tissue banking, and advancing regen-
erative medicine. However, the wide success achieved in cryopreservation of isolated cells [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] has not yet translated to the preservation of organs and tissues despite a dire
need. One of the grand challenges to organ cryopreservation is that the “larger” size of the organs and tissues
compared to single cells introduces a new and poorly understood form of damage caused by the excessive
thermo-mechanical stresses, which leads to loss of biological function [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].
Most soft tissues contain ∼50 to ∼70% water. When tissues are frozen, the water undergoes phase change
to ice progressively throughout the tissue; the frozen tissue then continues to cool down further until the
desired temperatures are reached. It is understood in the cryopreservation literature that different mech-
anisms of damage are at play in these two stages. While in the first stage, dynamics of freezing/thawing,
nucleation of ice crystals, and their interaction with cell membranes are the key contributors, in the sec-
ond stage, bulk mechanical stresses due to phase-change induced volume change and differential thermal
expansion/contraction due to temperature gradients are the major factors.

These stresses, when severe, cause tissues to progressively lose structural integrity (“damage”) and ulti-
mately develop visible cracks (see Figure 1).

aspects

cess.
Early

of

tis-
sues observed mechan-
ical damage ranging from
microscopic fractures [28, 29] to catastrophic gross fractures [30] during the entire cycle of freezing and thaw-
ing. Due to the non-uniform cooling of tissues (initiated from the boundaries and progressing to the interior),
different regions of the tissues expand differently. Prior modeling efforts have indeed tested and confirmed
this hypothesis and revealed important insights into the thermal stresses that develop during the freezing of
tissues [18, 31, 20, 21] and in heart geometries [32]. In addition to reaffirming the experimental observations
that thermal stresses are indeed high enough to push the tissues beyond their elastic limit, they also con-
cluded that mechanical damage to the tissue is unavoidable no matter how slow the cooling is carried out
[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 33]. Studies in cylindrically symmetric settings showed that the volumetric expansion
associated with the phase change of water (∼9%) is a significant contributor to the thermal stress (can
elevate the maximum equivalent stress by ∼2-3x higher in renal tissues)[34, 35].
Prior theoretical and computational efforts to model thermo-mechanical failures have largely focused on
stress analyses and on avoiding fracture in simpler geometries, such as spheres and cylinders, to facilitate
analytical tractability. Furthermore, these studies are generally limited to simplified linear elastic or elastic-
plastic models, which do not capture the non-linear elastic response that is typical of tissues. Additionally,
there is lack of theoretical and computational modeling that is able predict the evolution of damage due
to thermo-mechanical stresses in tissues, which eventually leads to fracture. While fracture is certainly in-
dicative of failure of the tissue and the cryopreservation protocol itself, damage is likely to be a more useful
indicator of the extent of loss of biological function.
Cryopreservation involves a confluence of thermal and mechanical processes that are intricately coupled,
making it necessary to develop a fully coupled description of the processes, something that is currently
missing from the literature. Motivated by the importance of cryopreservation to human health and the
existing mechanistic gaps in the literature, this works presents a fully-coupled, thermo-mechanically consis-
tent framework for modeling freezing-induced damage in water-saturated soft materials, formulated within
a finite deformation setting. This effort will focus on developing a mechanistic picture of the second stage
of the cryopreservation process, where bulk thermo-mechanical stresses play a crucial role.
Freezing of tissues is a complex biophysical process. Our approach to modeling is to develop the simplest
model that captures all the relevant physical (thermo-mechanical) factors at play namely heat transfer,
phase change, mechanical stresses and deformations, and the ensuing damage. To this end, we integrate two
2


phase-field models—one for fracture (or material damage) and one for the freezing process—into a unified
continuum mechanics formulation. In contrast to prior cryopreservation models that relied on simplified
geometries or linearized material behavior, our framework can accommodate complex geometries and in-
corporates a nonlinear elastic description of the soft tissue. The phase change from liquid water to ice is
described by a continuously varying field that triggers volumetric expansion upon solidification, and this is
coupled to the stress analysis so that thermal expansion/contraction and solidification-induced strain are
naturally included. Similarly, the phase-field damage variable is coupled to the mechanical response, de-
grading the stiffness of the material as the material progressively loses its structural integrity under severe
stresses. By solving the strongly coupled heat transfer, phase transformation, and mechanical equilibrium
equations, the model can capture the interplay between temperature evolution, ice formation, and mechan-
ical damage in a way that is not possible with existing approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first
theoretical framework that combines phase-field fracture and phase-field freezing in a finite-strain setting
for soft biological materials.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In §2 we describe the thermo-mechanical theoretical framework,
that integrates heat transfer, phase change, mechanical deformation/stresses, and damage. The framework
is then specialized in §3 to a chosen set of free energies to derive the relevant governing equations. The
numerical implementation of the framework is validated through a selection of test problems in §4. The
capabilities of the model are demonstrated by application of the specialized framework to four representative
cases in §5. We conclude with a brief discussion of the results and future directions in §6.
2. Thermo-mechanical Theoretical Framework
In this section we develop a coupled thermo-mechanical framework for modeling of evolution of damage in
a freezing material over time.
2.1. Kinematic Descriptors
We develop a theory that is based on the following kinematic descriptors: {χ, F, d, ∇d, T, ∇T, ϕ, ∇ϕ}. Here,
χ is the deformation field and F := ∇χ is the deformation gradient; 0 ≤d ≤1 is a damage phase field, which
represents pristine material when d = 0 and completely broken material when d = 1; T is the temperature;
and, lastly, 0 ≤ϕ ≤1 is a freezing phase field which represents frozen material when ϕ = 0 and unfrozen
when ϕ = 1. The aim of the theory is to solve for {χ, d, T, ϕ}.
Since thermal expansion/contraction is a significant contributor to freezing stresses, we will adopt a Kr¨oner-
Lee multiplicative decomposition [36] of the deformation gradient F into elastic and phase change parts Fe
and Fph as
F = FeFph,
where
J ≡det F,
Je ≡det Fe > 0, and Jph ≡det Fph > 0.
(2.1)
In this work, we will consider Fph = (1+ϵT (T, ϕ))1, with ϵT (T, ϕ) being the transformation strain associated
with thermal contraction/expansion and phase change.
2.2. Macroscopic and Microscopic Force Balance
We employ the Principle of Virtual Power (PVP), following the approach of Germain [37], to derive the
macroscopic and microscopic force balances involving our chosen kinematic variables and their associated
power conjugates.
PVP requires that
1. The virtual power of all internal and external forces acting on a system, for any admissible virtual
motion, be null;
2. The internal virtual power be an objective quantity.

Internal virtual power, Pi is:

where P (Tensorial Stress), ω (Scalar Microstress), ζ (Vector Microstress), π (Scalar Microstress), ξ (Vector
Microstress) are defined as power conjugates to ˙F (distortion rate), ˙d (rate of damage), ∇˙d (gradient of rate
of damage), ˙ϕ (rate of freezing), and ∇˙ϕ (gradient of rate of freezing) respectively. The subscript R denotes
the reference configuration and indicates that the above integral is expressed in reference configuration. B

ence volume and tR is the external mechan-
ical traction that expend power on v (veloc-
ity);
k

power on
˙d and
˙ϕ respectively; l and β are
microstresses that expend power on ∇˙d and
∇˙ϕ respectively; h and γ are microscopic trac-
tions that expend power on
˙d and
˙ϕ respec-
tively; g and π are microscopic tractions that
expend power on ∇˙d and ∇˙ϕ respectively; all
quantities are defined in reference configura-
tion.
We require that Pi is objective under the transformation x∗= y(t) + Q(t)(x −o), where Q(t) ∈SO(3) is
an orthogonal rotation matrix, which gives the following transformation rules:
P∗= QP,
PF⊤= P⊤F
(2.4a)
ω∗= ω,
π∗= π,
(2.4b)
ζ∗= Qζ,
ξ∗= Qξ
(2.4c)
Finally, from Pi = Pe, we obtain the following macroscopic and microscopic balances1

1In this calculation, it is implicitly assumed that there are no external volume fields that expend power on the ˙d, ∇˙d, ˙ϕ,
and ∇˙ϕ, thus nullifying k, l, α, and β.

2.3. First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics
For thermodynamic consistency, the theory must satisfy the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics.
Following the internal virtual power form in (2.6), the First Law of Thermodynamics gives the following
balance of energy in B,
˙e = P: ˙F + ω ˙d + ζ · ∇˙d + π ˙ϕ + ξ · ∇˙ϕ + r −∇· qR,
(2.7)
where e is the internal energy per unit reference volume, r is some volumetric internal heating source per
unit reference volume, and qR is the heat-flux vector expressed in the referential form. The remaining terms
correspond to the power expended on the system by various stresses, microforces, and microstresses.
Aside on Stress Power.
We also note here that in view of equation (2.1), ˙F, ˙Fe, and ˙Fph are related.
Thus, the term P : ˙F can be split into the following terms [38],
P : ˙F = JσF−e⊤: ˙Fe + JFe⊤σF−e⊤: ˙FphFph−1
(2.8)
where σ = J−1PF⊤is the Cauchy Stress tensor. Since the strain energy functions are typically expressed
as functions of the elastic right Cauchy-Green tensor Ce, the above equation can be recast following the
approach in [38] as,
P : ˙F = 1
2σe : ˙Ce −¯p ˙Jph
(2.9)
where
σe =Fe−1JσFe−⊤= Fe−1PFph⊤,
(2.10)
Ce =Fe⊤Fe,
and
(2.11)
¯p = −1
3Jetr(PF⊤/J)
(2.12)
By introducing the Helmholtz free energy ψ = e −Ts, where s is the entropy per unit reference volume, we
can rearrange the internal energy equation (2.7), using (2.9), as
T ˙s = 1
2σe : ˙Ce + ω ˙d + ζ · ∇˙d +

π −¯p∂Jph

˙ϕ + ξ · ∇˙ϕ + r −∇· qR −˙ψ −˙T

∂T

(2.13)
where we have used ˙Jph = ∂Jph
∂ϕ
˙ϕ + ∂Jph
∂T
˙T.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy change of the system and surround-
ings must be non-negative. This translates into the following requirement, also known as the Dissipation
Inequality:
D ≡1
2σe : ˙Ce + ω ˙d + ζ · ∇˙d +

Assuming a general form for the Helmholtz free energy as ψ ≡ψ(Ce, d, ∇d, T, ∇T, ϕ, ∇ϕ), the ˙ψ term can
be expanded as follows,
˙ψ = ∂ψ
∂Ce : ˙Ce + ∂ψ

˙d + ∂ψ
∂∇d · ∇˙d + ∂ψ
∂T
˙T + ∂ψ

˙ϕ + ∂ψ
∂∇ϕ · ∇˙ϕ,
(2.15)
which yields the following concise form for the dissipation inequality,

In general, any choice that is consistent with (2.16) is a valid choice.
In the above application of the
Coleman-Noll procedure, we make a specific constitutive choice that π has an energetic and a dissipative
part. This will be complemented with an evolution equation for ϕ in the next subsection. M > 0 is a
mobility constant, and KR(Ce, d, ϕ, T) > 0 is the thermal conductivity.
2.5. Damage-informed Temperature and Freezing Evolution
Temperature Evolution.
Starting from the entropy evolution equation (2.13) and using equations (2.15)
and (2.17a)-(2.17g), we get the following simplified equation for entropy evolution
T ˙s = πdiss. ˙ϕ + r −∇· qR.
(2.18)
Recalling from equation (2.17b) that s = −¯p∂Jph

Freezing Phase Field Evolution.
From the microscopic balance law (2.5e) and scalar microstress equa-
tion (2.17d), we obtain
∇· ∂ψ
∂∇ϕ = πenergetic + πdiss.,
(2.20)
which gives the following form for πdiss.
πdiss. = ∇· ∂ψ

the constitutive equations, the model applies to rate-dependent damage as well.
3. Specialization of Framework
As an illustrative example, we will specialize the general model developed in §2 to specific choices of free
energies and derive the relevant governing equations. We choose the following form for the free energies for
this exercise:
ψ(Ce, d, ∇d, T, ϕ, ∇ϕ) = ψel(Ce, d) + ψcrack(d, ∇d, ϕ) + ψthermal(T, ϕ, ∇ϕ),
(3.1)
where the first term is the elastic strain energy stored in the material, the second term is the diffused fracture
(or damage) energy (equivalent to
R
GcdA in Griffith’s theory [40]), and the last term is the thermal energy.
In the following, we will specialize each of these energies to a specific form.
3.1. Nonlinear elasticity: slightly compressible neo-Hookean model
The elastic free energy for a neo-Hookean model is chosen to be
ψel(Ce, d) = gd(d)
µ


(3.2)
where gd(d) = (1 −d)2 is a degradation function that degrades the elastic energy density (more discussion
in the next subsection), ¯I1 = tr ¯Ce and ¯Ce = Je−2/3Ce. From the constitutive relation (2.17a), we obtain

to ensure that the crack does not heal.

Cauchy and Piola-Kirchoff stresses are then obtained as,

where p = −K ln Je/Je. Furthermore, we get
¯p = −gd(d)Je
J K ln Je.
(3.6)
We will consider Fph = (1 + ϵT (ϕ, T))1 for this specialization; the functional form is given in §3.3.
3.2. Damage
A number of damage models have been proposed in the literature that smear the crack over a finite width
and thus regularize the sharp interface crack problem [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]7. There
are recent works in the literature that have proposed theories that unify nucleation and crack propagation
in a single framework by means of a strength surface. On the other hand, classical models have proposed
choosing the length scale such that the tensile strength of the material matches the localization stress from
the models. The focus of the current work is not to propose a new damage model or comment on their
relative strengths, but on the overall framework that integrates the various physical processes together. To
this end, the framework presented in §2 can be adapted to any suitable choice of damage model appropriate
for the specific material and problem at hand. Here, for purposes of illustration of the framework, we will
choose the AT2 model where the free energy associated with cracking is,
ψcrack =
Z
B
Gcγ(d, ∇d)dV,
(3.7)
where
γ(d, ∇d) = w(d)
2l
+ l
2|∇d|2
(3.8)
is the crack surface density function, w(d) = d2 is a geometric function that controls local fracture energy,
and Gc is the critical energy release rate and is assumed to be a material property. In the limit of the
regularization length l →0, the minimization problem converges to the classical sharp-crack problem.
In this specialization, we have chosen a simple degradation scheme that degrades both the isochoric and
volumetric parts of the energy. A more sophisticated split can be easily achieved in this framework. For
the case of tissues in particular, biological damage can happen even under compression which may lead
to mechanical damage (loss in ability to sustain loads), thus an appropriate split of the energy is an open
research question in itself.
3.3. Phase Change
The solidification phase field ϕ ∈[0, 1] is defined such that ϕ = 0 represents the frozen phase while ϕ = 1
represents the unfrozen phase.
We choose the thermal free energy, ψthermal as comprising a symmetric
double-well potential function that presents an energy barrier to freezing and a temperature-dependent
latent heat term that introduces asymmetry in the free energy.
ψthermal = f0g(ϕ) + ∆f(T)p(ϕ) + β
2 |∇ϕ|2
(3.9)
where ∆f(T) = L(Tm −T)/Tm, g(ϕ) = ϕ2(1 −ϕ)2, p(ϕ) = ϕ3(6ϕ2 −15ϕ + 10), and Tm is the melting
temperature. For these choices, p′(ϕ) = 30g(ϕ). Finally, for transformation strain for phase change, we
choose ϵT (ϕ, T) = ϵ0(1 −p(ϕ)) + α(ϕ)(T −Tm), where ϵ0 is the transformation strain associated with phase
change from water to ice, and α(ϕ) = ϕαwater + (1 −ϕ)αice is the effective coefficient of thermal expansion.
Figure 3 shows a sketch of the various functional forms.
7We do not attempt to present an exhaustive literature review of damage modeling in this work.

M ˙ϕ2 is a valid term that shows in this formulation, as also reported in [53]. However, we will drop this term under the

4. Benchmarking of the Model and Numerical Implementation
In this section we will test the various modules of our model and numerical implementation by applying it
to simplified problems whose solutions can be obtained analytically.
4.1. Numerical Implementation
The coupled thermomechanical phase-field damage model is implemented within theFEniCSfinite element
framework [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62].
Discretization.
The computational domains considered in §4 & 5 are discretized either using meshes
generated natively withinFEniCSor using an external mesh generator “Gmsh” [63] and imported into the
solver via the XDMF format. A mixed finite element method was employed for spatial discretization. The
displacement field u was approximated using continuous second-order (P2) Lagrange elements, while the
pressure p, temperature T, and phase-field c were approximated with continuous first-order (P1) elements to
form a stable Taylor-Hood-like element for the (u, p) pair. The damage field d and damage rate ˙d were solved
in a separate P1 function space. Time integration was performed using a first-order, implicit backward-Euler
scheme.
Solution Strategy.
A staggered (operator-split) solution strategy [64] was employed at each time step to
handle the multi-physics coupling. The iterative procedure within a time step proceeds as follows:
1. First, the monolithic coupled system for the primary fields (u, p, T, c) was solved. This step incorpo-
rates the thermal source term from damage, utilizing the damage rate ˙d calculated from the previous
staggered iteration.
2. Next, the elastic energy density ψel was computed to serve as the damage driving force H in accordance
with (3.19).
3. Using this updated history field, the separate non-linear damage evolution problem for d was solved.
4. Finally, the damage rate field ˙d was updated using the new damage solution.
10


This process was iterated until the L2-norm of the change in the damage field fell below a relative tolerance
of 10−4. All non-linear systems were solved using a Newton-Raphson method, and resulting linear systems
were resolved via the MUMPS parallel direct sparse solver.
4.2. Finite Deformation: Uniaxial loading with prescribed displacement
We consider a 2D, unit square with u2(X1, X2 = 0) = 0 and u2(X1, X2 = 1) =utop, as shown in the figure 4.
No other displacements are constrained (other than pinning the bottom left corner to prevent translation)
and the left and right boundaries are traction-free. The analytical solution for this problem for a nearly
incompressible neo-Hookean material under plane strain conditions is given as,

where λ1 and λ2 are stretches in 1- and 2-directions, respectively. Equation (4.1) can be solved for given
values of λ2, and equation (4.2) can then be used to obtain the corresponding value of P22. The numerical
results match the analytical results (Fig. 4(b)).

4.3. Heat Transfer and Solidification Problem
We apply the model to capture the propagation of a planar freezing front in an effort to validate the results
with the classic Stefan problem (Fig. 5). For a purely thermal problem (ie. no mechanical coupling), the
evolution equations for temperature and freezing phase field are
Cv ˙T = KR∇2T −T

Figure 6 shows the location of the freezing front (defined as the X1-coordinate where ϕ = 0.5) as a function
of time τ = t/tR for three different values of the mobility parameter M. As the mobility increases, the
results from the simulation approach the sharp interface Stefan’s solution where the location of the front in
an infinite, 1-D setting is proportional to t1/2. These results validate the thermal/phase change behavior of
the framework and its FEniCS implementation.

4.4. Damage Problem: Single Edge Notch Tension Test (SENT)
We validate the damage component of the model by applying it to a single edge notch tension test on a
sample made of linear elastic material. The setting is isothermal and the phase field is set to ϕ = 1. Thus,
only the mechanical part of the model is active. In the linear elastic setting, there is no distinction between
First Piola Kirchoff stress and Cauchy stress. These are given by
σ =
E
(1 + ν)(1 −2ν) [(1 −2ν)ϵ + ν(trϵ)1]
(4.5)
where ϵ is the infinitesimal strain tensor, and E and ν are the Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio of the
material, respectively. Figure 7 shows the schematic of the test. The sample is rectangular with width b
and height 2h. The crack has a length a. Values used for these parameters are reported in Table 2.

5. Representative Cases
In this section, we apply the specialized framework from §3 to four representative cases. While the framework
is dimension-agnostic, we will consider plane strain setting for these cases. We will use the material properties
listed in Table 3, unless stated otherwise. Where available, parameters such as the elastic moduli (µ, K) and
thermal properties (Cv, KR) have been chosen to be representative of soft biological tissues (e.g., liver). The
value of Gc for brittle frozen tissues was not readily available, thus, its value has been chosen for convenience
to illustrate the mechanics. The phase-field parameters (e.g., f0, β, M) govern the phenomenological aspects
of the model, such as the energy barrier for phase change, the diffuse interface width, and the kinetic mobility.
As these are not typically available from direct physical measurement, they have been selected to ensure
numerical stability, convergence, and computational efficiency. For a direct, quantitative comparison with
specific experimental data, these model-specific parameters would be calibrated to match the observed
experimental length- and time-scales.

5.1. Case I: Unconstrained freezing of a square sample
We consider an LR × LR sample with temperature prescribed as T0 = 193 K (−80◦C) on all boundaries.
The sample is mechanically unconstrained, ie. all boundaries are traction-free. Freezing and damage phase
fields are subject to natural boundary conditions on all boundaries.
The initial temperature of the sample is set at 273 K (0◦C), which is also taken to be the freezing temper-
ature. To initiate the freezing phase transformation in numerics, a thin layer near the boundaries, where ϕ
transitions from a very low value (ϕ ∼0) to unfrozen (ϕ = 1), is set as initial condition on all the boundaries,
which is prescribed in accordance with the following form:
ϕi(X) = 1
2 [1 + tanh (γ (d(X) −δ))] ,
(5.1)
where
d(X) = min(X1, LR −X1, X2, LR −X2),
γ = 80/LR controls the interface steepness, and δ = 0.02LR controls the interface width. Figure 8 shows
the schematic of the setup.
Figure 9 shows the evolution of temperature, freezing phase field, damage, and stress fields along a plane
through the center of the domain (X2/LR = 0.5), for three different instances of time: τ = t/tR = 0, 0.1,
and 0.2, where tR = CvL2
R/KR is a reference timescale. The simulations are carried out for a dimensional
time of 34.2s. Contour plots in figure 10 show the spatial evolution of various fields at the conclusion of the
simulation (τ = 0.2). The symmetry of the problem setup reflects in the evolution of the fields.

Figure 9: Evolution of (a) temperature, (b) freezing phase field, (c) damage, (d) P11, and (e) P22 fields for the unconstrained
freezing setup across X2/LR = 0.5 line. The fields are shown at three different instants of time: τ = t/tR = 0, 0.1, and 0.2,
where the reference time is tR = 171 s.
As the sample starts to cool down, and undergo phase change, differential thermal and phase-change expan-
sions across the sample induce stresses and damage; this can be seen in the dashed red plots for τ = 0.1. By
the end of the simulation, the entire sample is nearly completely frozen and the temperature gradients are
gentle. Thus, the stresses in this unconstrained sample start to vanish, as is shown by the dashed blue plots
in figure 9. The damage generated during this evolution is, however, irreversible, and does not disappear
when the entire sample has reached thermal and phase-change equilibrium.

Figure 10: Spatial distribution of (a) temperature, (b) freezing phase field, (c) damage, (d) P11, (e) P22, and (f) P12 fields
for the unconstrained freezing setup for Case I. The fields are shown at the end of the simulation at τ = t/tR = 0.2, where the
reference time is tR = 171 s.
5.2. Case II: Constrained freezing of a square sample
The thermal, freezing, and damage boundary conditions are the same as in case I, namely: we consider an
LR × LR sample with temperature prescribed as T0 = 193 K (−80◦C) on all boundaries, and freezing and
damage phase fields are subject to natural boundary conditions on all boundaries. The sample is mechan-
ically constrained: u2 = 0 on the bottom boundary (X2/LR = 0) and u2 = 0.02LR on the top boundary
(X2/LR = 1).
The initial conditions are exactly the same as that of case I, namely: the initial temperature of the sample
is set at 273 K (0◦C) and the freezing phase-field is initialized as ϕ(X, t = 0) = ϕi(X). Figure 11 shows a
schematic of the problem setup.
Figure 12 shows the evolution of temperature, freezing phase field, damage, and stress fields along a plane
through the center of the domain (X2/LR = 0.5), for three different instances of time: τ = t/tR = 0, 0.1,
and 0.2, where tR = CvL2
R/KR is the reference timescale. The simulations are carried out for a dimensional
time of 34.2s. Contour plots in figure 13 show the spatial evolution of various fields at the conclusion of the
simulation (τ = 0.2).
Similar to case I, differential thermal and phase-change expansions drive the stresses during the evolution
of freezing in the sample. The sample is nearly entirely frozen by the end of the simulation; in contrast
to case I, the stresses do not vanish. This is because the sample is mechanically constrained and the final
state of stress reflects the imposed displacement boundary conditions in the 2-direction. This is why P22
is non-zero. Further, since the accumulated damage is non-uniform, the resulting P22 is also non-uniform.
Notably, the peak damage in case I and case II are similar10, possibly indicating that mechanical constraint

5.3. Case III: Freeze-thaw temperature conditions in square sample
We consider a square annulus geometry in this case, as shown in Figure 14(a). Temperature is prescribed
on all boundaries and is a function of time, given by ¯Tin(t) on the inner boundary and ¯Tout(t) on the outer
boundary. The functional forms for temperature boundary conditions are given by equations (5.2) and (5.3)
for a time period P and are visually represented in Figure 14(b). The prescribed temperature evolution is
designed to show the behavior of the sample under freezing and subsequent thawing conditions, which are
typical of cryopreservation protocols.

The initial conditions are exactly the same as that of cases I and II, namely: the initial temperature of the
sample is set at 273 K (0◦C) and the freezing phase-field is initialized as ϕ(X, t = 0) = ϕi(X).
For this particular study, we use β = 8×10−3 J/m. Figure 15 shows snapshots of fields at different instances
of time along the line X2/LR = 0. During the cooling and then warming phase back to freezing temperature
on the outer boundary (from A-C), the freezing front proceeds inwards from the boundaries (Fig. 15(b);
τA →τB →τC), which leads to development of stresses and induces damage. The temperature is then held
constant at Tm on the outer boundary; the inner boundary temperature is raised slowly to T = 1.2Tm (C-D)
18


and then held constant (D-E). This triggers thawing of the sample, and the freezing front starts to reverse
back towards the outer boundary, as can be seen in the movement of the freezing from τC →τD →τE.
Notably, damage is induced in the freezing process but not in the thawing process in this case. This happens
because of the following reason: the transformation strain from freezing is the dominant contributor to the
stress. As the freezing front moves inwards, it causes a spike in the strain energy density across the front,
which drives damage. During the thawing process, the strain energy density across the front stays below the
previously experienced peak strain energy and thus does not induce additional damage (see Figure A.23).
Just like in Case I, the boundaries of the sample are mechanically unconstrained; a stronger constraint of
all boundaries being fixed rapidly induces a much higher damage in the sample (in results not included in
the present study). The dominant stress component along the X2/LR = 0 line is P22; P11 remains much
smaller during the entire process. The spatial distribution of fields at the end of the simulation is presented
in figure 16.

5.4. Case IV: Fixed temperature and displacement boundary conditions in an
irregular shape
In this case, we consider an irregular shape to showcase the broad applicability of the model. A fixed tem-
perature T0 = 193 K (−80◦C) is prescribed on the entire boundary. The displacements are constrained such
that the entire boundary is fixed. Natural boundary conditions apply to damage and freezing phase fields.
The entire domain is initially at the freezing temperature of Tm = 273 K. To initiate freezing, a thin strip
around the boundary of the domain that smoothly evolves from ϕ = 0 to ϕ = 1 is prescribed as the initial
condition.

For this particular study, we use Gc = 1 N/m, µ = 1 kPa, and β = 8 × 10−3 J/m. Other parameters remain
the same as in Table 3. Figure 18 shows the evolution of temperature, freezing phase field, damage fields,
and stresses along a plane through the center of the domain (X2/LR = 0), for three different instances of
time: τ = t/tR = 0, 0.00356, and 0.00712, where tR = CvL2
R/KR is a reference timescale. The simulations
are carried out for a dimensional time of ∼1.2 s. Contour plots in figure 19 show the spatial evolution of
various fields at the conclusion of the simulation (τ = 0.00712).
We find that the mechanical constraint imposed in this problem is “stronger”, in contrast to Case II, since
the damage starts to develop early on in the entire sample (see also Appendix A for more detailed time
evolution contour plots).

The damage appears to severely localize near the curved region along the center of the domain. The curvature
tends to concentrate stresses, which in turn drive damage. In general, regions of stress concentrations are
more prone to damage.
6. Discussion, Conclusion, and Future Work
We have developed a thermodynamically consistent, thermo-mechanically coupled finite deformation model
for capturing the freezing-induced damage in soft materials. The developed framework is by nature modular
in the way it accounts for various sources of energy contributions, and therefore, easily extensible to include
other physics, if necessary.
The representative cases showcase the capability of the model to capture a
diverse range of thermal and mechanical scenarios. Results also show that mechanical constraints can sig-
nificantly affect the stresses experienced by the sample and the resulting damage. In case II, the mechanical
constraint of applied displacement in the 2-direction is “weaker” than the constraint applied in case IV,
where displacement on all boundaries is zero. The latter, thus, shows significantly higher damage starting
much earlier in the process.
Current work is a first step in the direction of developing a comprehensive and predictive understanding

grows rapidly in this system.
of the cryopreservation mechanics. While this work successfully integrates multiple physical processes into
a comprehensive framework, it is worth nothing that there are important open problems which need to be
addressed in future works on this topic. Below we list some such opportunities for investigation:
• As touched upon in the introduction, the model focuses on the development of bulk thermo-mechanical
stresses developed in the second stage of the freezing process, and does not account for internal
transport of water. Furthermore, the model does not have an explicit freezing nucleation mechanism
built in. Addressing these two phenomena in the modeling can widen the applicability of the model
to early stages of the freezing process as well.
• The choice of damage model is an area with significant scope for more exploration. While the cur-
rent framework provides a baseline for damage evolution, future works will focus on integrating more
sophisticated models. The current formulation can be extended to include rate-dependent damage,
which is likely important as tissues are subjected to protocols involving varying rates of cooling and
thawing. Future works will integrate other damage models proposed recently in the mechanics com-
munity that could more accurately simulate the initiation and propagation of damage across a range
of samples, from pristine materials to those with existing cracks.
• Lastly, the present work focuses on a simplified abstraction of tissue as a nonlinear elastic material.
Future works may focus on a more nuanced description of the tissue microstructure including cells and
extracellular matrix. This may be achieved in simplified continuum-scale models through inclusion of
spatial variation of material properties, anisotropy of elastic and thermal properties, and the incorpo-
ration of viscoelasticity, which accounts for the time-dependent mechanical response of soft biological
materials.
The thermodynamically consistent approach presented here and the resulting framework provide a robust
22


foundation to advance modeling efforts in future, including in all of the above directions.

Figure A.23: Plot of elastic energy density and freezing phase field at (X1/LR, X2/LR) = (−0.375, 0) as a function of time.
The maximum strain energy is experienced during the inward movement of the freezing front, which dictates the extent of
damage. The thawing process does not incur additional damage because the peak strain energy density remains lower than
during freezing.
