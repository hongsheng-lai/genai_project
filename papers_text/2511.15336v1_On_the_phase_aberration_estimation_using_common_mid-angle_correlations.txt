On the phase aberration estimation using
common mid-angle correlations
Naiara Korta Martiartu and Michael Jaeger
Abstract— Phase aberrations, despite degrading ultrasound images, also encode valuable information about the
spatial distribution of the speed of sound in tissue. In pulse-echo ultrasound, we can quantify them by exploiting
speckle correlations. Among existing strategies, correlations between steered acquisitions that share a common
mid-angle have proven particularly effective for inferring the speed of sound. Their phases can be linearly related
to the phase aberrations undergone by both the incident and reflected wavefronts. This relationship has so far
been demonstrated only through geometric arguments based on point reflectors. Here, we develop a rigorous
theoretical formalism that extends this relationship to the speckle regime, completing the previously established
linear model and clarifying its underlying assumptions. More importantly, we build on this formalism to analyze
correlation-phase fluctuations arising from aberration-induced speckle decorrelation. The analysis reveals that
phase variance is governed by the relative loss of coherence, which increases approximately linearly with the
square of the correlation phases. Local correlation-phase estimates therefore become increasingly uncertain as
their magnitude grows. Experimental measurements in a uniform tissue-mimicking phantom show excellent
agreement with the predicted variance. Beyond providing a theoretical basis for advancing speed-of-sound
imaging, this formalism establishes the accuracy limit of common-mid-angle correlation phases, offering a
benchmark for evaluating more advanced aberration-estimation techniques.

I. INTRODUCTION
I
N pulse-echo ultrasound, we use a transducer array to
isonify the tissue with a set of incident pressure waves.
Variations in the acoustic impedance scatter the waves back,
which are subsequently recorded by the same array. The
measured pressure fields are then synthetically focused at each
tissue position in both emission and reception to reconstruct
a map of tissue reflectivity. This focusing operation forms
the basis of conventional ultrasound imaging. It is typically
implemented using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, which
assumes a uniform speed of sound to calculate the travel times
of the incident and reflected waves. Tissues, however, often
contain large-scale speed-of-sound heterogeneities that distort
the ultrasound wavefronts, leading to discrepancies between
the estimated and actual travel times. These phase errors,
or phase aberrations, can severely degrade the resolution
of ultrasound images and ultimately hinder their diagnostic
interpretation [1].
Explicit estimation of phase aberrations provides a direct
means of correcting their detrimental effects on ultrasound
images. Once estimated, the phase errors can be subtracted
from the initially assumed travel times to restore focus.
Traditional techniques rely on the assumption that speed-of-
sound inhomogeneities can be modeled as a thin phase screen

located at the transducer face. The relative phase errors across
the aperture, i.e., the phase screen, can then be estimated
from the cross-correlation of signals received at neighboring
elements [2], [3]. This estimation is accurate in the presence of
a bright, isolated point-like target (guide star); however, such
targets are rare in biological tissue, where diffuse scatterers
dominate. In this case, the accuracy depends on the degree
of correlation between speckle signals [4], [5], and itera-
tive focusing approaches are required to progressively reduce
decorrelation and refine phase-aberration estimation [2], [6].
Nevertheless, the near-field phase-screen model assumes that
aberrations are spatially invariant over the entire medium
(isoplanatism), meaning that a single phase-error profile, or
phase-aberration law, can be applied to the beamformer to
compensate for their effects. While this simplification may
be reasonable for localized aberrators such as a superficial
adipose layer, speed-of-sound inhomogeneities generally occur
throughout the tissue, causing aberrations that remain invari-
ant only within small regions (isoplanatic patch). Therefore,
aberrations should ideally be estimated and corrected locally.
The common approach to local phase-aberration estimation
is to exploit the correlations between signals acquired from
different emissions, receptions, or both [7]–[11]. The locally
adaptive phase aberration correction (LAPAC) method [8],
for example, extracts phase-aberration laws by analyzing
correlations among time-delayed waveforms recorded from
single-element emissions. Although such emissions benefit
from spatial reciprocity, allowing the same correction to be
applied on both transmit and receive, they inherently suffer
from a low signal-to-noise ratio and are thus rarely used in
practice. Ultrasound matrix imaging, which decouples transmit

and receive focal spots during beamforming, offers a more
general framework for quantifying aberrations under arbitrary
acquisition schemes [9], [12]. With simple matrix operations,
the transmit (or receive) focal spots can be projected, for
example, into the far-field to synthesize plane-wave emissions,
while maintaining the receive (or transmit) side focused. This
enables correlations between different emissions (or recep-
tions) to be analyzed directly on the focused basis, which is
more practical than operating on the raw waveforms. Because
aberrations also affect the focused side, the estimated aber-
ration laws inevitably mix contributions from both incident
and reflected waves. To address this, an iterative procedure
is employed, alternating estimation and correction between
transmit and receive, to progressively improve the focusing
quality and refine the aberration laws [10], [13]. Nevertheless,
the interpretation of the final estimates is challenging, as the
iterative correction cannot address axial aberrations [14]. This
limitation arises from the fundamental inability of correlations
to constrain absolute phase aberrations. Knowledge of tissue
speed of sound appears essential to fully correct their effects
on ultrasound images [7], [14].
In the context of speed-of-sound imaging, alternative ap-
proaches have been proposed to jointly estimate phase aber-
rations in both transmit and receive [15], [16], recognizing
the fact that their individual contributions are difficult to
disentangle. In particular, computed ultrasound tomography in
echo-mode (CUTE) estimates phase aberrations by exploiting
correlations between steered acquisitions that share a com-
mon mid-angle [15], [17], [18]. Using entirely geometrical
arguments based on point-like reflectors, Staehli et al. [15]
demonstrated that the phases of these correlations are linearly
related to the phase errors accumulated along both transmit
and receive paths during beamforming. Nevertheless, a more
rigorous theoretical formalism is still lacking to understand the
assumptions underlying this relationship and to characterize
the stochastic nature of correlation phases in speckle. Estab-
lishing such a formalism is the primary goal of this paper.
We organize the paper into two main parts. The first part
(Section II) derives a closed-form expression for the expec-
tation of common-mid-angle correlations in the presence of
diffuse scatterers, with particular emphasis on the correlation
phases. This expression is compared with the correlation-
phase model used in CUTE, and its underlying assumptions
and limitations are discussed. The second part (Section III)
presents a theoretical analysis of speckle-induced fluctuations
in correlation-phase measurements, showing that the variance
of the correlation phases depends not only on the number
of resolution cells but also on the magnitude of the phases
themselves. This dependence arises from coherence loss due
to aberrations, and the contribution of clutter is also briefly
discussed. The theoretical variance is finally validated experi-
mentally in Section IV using a homogeneous tissue-mimicking
phantom. Concluding remarks and the significance of this
work are presented in Section V.
II. THEORY OF COMMON MID-ANGLE CORRELATIONS
Common-mid-angle correlations are typically measured us-
ing steered beams. These are synthesized in post-processing
by focusing in transmit and receive over a small angular
aperture [15]. The limited aperture yields relatively broad
beams whose wavefronts can be treated as locally planar.
In this section, we therefore consider plane waves in both
emission and reception for analytical tractability.
A. Images with Transmit-Receive Plane Waves
We consider an experiment in which a plane wave is
emitted into the tissue along the propagation direction
ˆkin = (sin φin, cos φin), and the response is measured along
the direction ˆkout = (sin φout, cos φout) by applying similar
time delays as in emission [19]. We assume that the emitted
waveform is a Gaussian-modulated sinusoidal pulse,
pe(t) = A (t) eiωct = e−t2/2σ2eiωct,
(1)
where ωc is the angular center frequency, and the temporal
width σ of the Gaussian envelope A controls the bandwidth.
Let χ(x) denote the scattering function of the tissue in the
domain Ω⊂R2. In the single-scattering regime, the image re-
constructed through time-delay compensation of the measured
response can be expressed as
I(r) =
Z
Ω
χ(x)A (t0(r) −t(x)) eiωc(t0(r)−t(x))dx.
(2)
Here, t is the total travel time of the recorded waves, whereas
t0 is computed by assuming a uniform speed of sound c0:

(4)
We define the mid-angle φm = (φin + φout)/2 and the angle
difference φd = (φin −φout)/2, for convenience.
Equation (3) shows that, for this type of measurement,
the isochrones are straight lines perpendicular to the di-
rection defined by the mid-angle between the transmit and
receive steering angles. Therefore, we define a new coordinate
system aligned with the mid-angle direction ˆkm in which
r = rmˆkm + rpˆkp and x = xmˆkm + xpˆkp ∈Ω= Ωm × Ωd.
The vector ˆkp refers to the direction perpendicular to ˆkm. In
this coordinate system, the image I(r) reduces to
I(rm) =

and

(7)
The scattering function ˜χ(xm) represents the integral of χ(x)
along the direction ˆkp, i.e., the average tissue reflectivity in
this direction. Equations (5)–(7) show that the point-spread
function (PSF) A(r, x), and therefore the image I(r), varies
only along the mid-angle direction (Fig. 1). Thus, the images
obtained with transmit-receive plane waves sharing a common

image is shown at the top for reference. Data were acquired in a uniform
tissue-mimicking phantom (see Sec. IV). Each row corresponds to a
pair of transmit and receive propagation directions (solid arrows) that
share a common mid-angle (dashed lines). The images are spatially
invariant along the direction perpendicular to ˆkm; therefore, when ˆkm is
unchanged, the images remain well correlated.
mid-angle φm encode similar spatial frequencies of χ(x) and
are strongly correlated. An explicit expression for these corre-
lations is derived in the next subsection, where the subscript
m is omitted to simplify notation.
B. Correlation of Images with Common Mid-Angle
We consider two recordings corresponding to the angle
combinations (ˆk1
in, ˆk1
out) and (ˆk2
in, ˆk2
out), with identical mid-
angles ˆk1
m = ˆk2
m. Let I1 and I2 denote their respective images
obtained as in (2). Our goal is to estimate the expected value
of the correlations between I1 and I2, in the vicinity of each
image location ξ. This can be expressed as
⟨C(ξ)⟩= 1

⟨I1(r)I∗

(8)
with L the size of the correlation kernel [15]. In a first
approximation, we model the tissue as a random distribu-
tion of unresolved scatterers, leading to the speckle pattern
commonly observed in ultrasound images. Tissue scatter-
ers are therefore assumed to be spatially uncorrelated, i.e.,
⟨˜χ(x1)˜χ(x2)⟩= ˜Xδ(x1 −x2), with δ the Dirac distribution
and ˜X = ⟨|˜χ|2⟩[4]. Under this assumption and using the
expression in (5), the ensemble-averaged term in (8) becomes
⟨I1I∗
2⟩= ˜X

B (r, x) eiωc(τ1(r,x)−τ2(r,x))dx,
(9)
with
B (r, x) = A (τ1(r, x)) A (τ2(r, x)) .
(10)
Since the PSFs Ai := A (τi(r, x)) are Gaussian functions,
the function B is also a Gaussian, and we can leverage the
symmetry around its mean to solve the integral in (9). The
mean µB and standard deviation σB of B can be analytically
computed from the means µAi and standard deviations σAi of
Ai. To derive their expression, we write the tissue location
x as a deviation from the image location: x = r + δx. This
allows us to approximate the true travel times as
t(x) ≈t(r) + t(δx) ≈t(r) + t0(δx),
(11)
where we assume that, for small δx, the difference between
the true and assumed travel times is negligible. We will discuss
the implications of this approximation later in this section.
By inserting (11) into (7), the travel time differences τi
between positions x and r can be written in terms of the
differences ∆ti(r) = t0,i(r) −ti(r) at the image location r:
τi(r, x) ≈∆ti(r) −2
c0
cos φd,iδx.
(12)
∆ti(r) corresponds to what is commonly referred to as time-
delay errors or phase aberrations. In contrast, τi describes how
the phase of the reconstructed echo varies spatially. At the
center of the reconstructed echo, where t0(r) = t(x), this
phase is zero. However, aberrations shift this center point
away from the true echo position by an amount equal to the
mean µAi (Fig. 2(a)). From the definition of Ai in (1) and (5),
together with the approximation in (12), we obtain
µAi = c0

∆ti(r)
cos φd,i
,
σAi =
c0σ
2 cos φd,i
.
(13)
As we observe from these expressions, different acquisitions
exhibit different displacements of the reconstructed echoes
(Fig. 2(b)), depending on the accumulated aberrations along
the transmit and receive propagation paths and their angle
difference φd. This difference in displacement is the reason
why relative phase aberrations can be quantified from corre-
lations. The reconstructed echoes are not merely shifted, but
their width, defined by the standard deviation σA, also varies
with the angle difference, independently of the aberrations
(Fig. 2(c)). Therefore, common mid-angle acquisitions do not
strictly probe identical spatial frequencies of tissue reflectiv-
ity, leading to slight decorrelation that increases with larger
differences between the two φd,i. This effect will be analyzed
in more detail in Sec. III.
Using (13), we can compute the mean and standard devia-
tion of B analytically (see Appendix I):

depends on the travel-time error ∆t (phase aberrations) and the angle difference φd between the transmit and receive directions. (b) Different
acquisitions with the same mid-angle yield different echo displacements. (c) The correlation phase ϕ(r) corresponds to the phase difference of the
reconstructed echoes, evaluated at the peak location of their PSF product.
The phase ϕ(r) corresponds to the phase difference between
reconstructed echoes at position µB (Fig. 2(c)):

(18)
When the image location r is far from the probe relative to σB,
the integration limits in (16) can be approximated as [−∞, ∞].
In fact, near the probe, plane waves are not well defined,
and these regions should be excluded from the correlations.
Appendix II shows that the integral in (16), denoted a(r)
in (49), is real-valued and therefore does not contribute to
the phase of ⟨I1I∗
2⟩. For small correlation kernels, this phase
can be considered constant (isoplanatism) to finally obtain
⟨C(ξ)⟩≈a(ξ) ˜Xeiϕ(ξ).
(19)
Thus, the argument of the correlation provides direct access to
the relative, local phase aberrations between the two images:

(20)
This phase is measured at the peak location of the product be-
tween the PSFs Ai, which can be viewed as a normal probabil-
ity distribution governing the phase measurement (Fig. 2(c)).
The term in parentheses arises from the relative shift of the
reconstructed echo positions, whereas the factor α accounts for
the stretching or shrinking of the spatial frequencies with the
change of the transmit and receive angles (k = 2ωc cos φd/c0).
C. New Insights
Using geometrical arguments, Staehli et al. [15] found a
similar relationship between correlation phases and aberra-
tions. Our result (20), however, contains an angle-dependent
factor α that was omitted in [15], although the authors noted
that the spatial frequencies vary with φd. While α ≈1 is
reasonable for small angles, larger values of φd lead to in-
creasing phase-modeling errors (Fig. 3). In particular, α could

play a significant role in the adaptation of CUTE to emerging
multi-aperture systems with larger angular coverage [20].
Correlation phases are linked not to the aberrations at the
true scatterer location x, but rather to those at the image
location r. This distinction is important for two reasons. First,
the estimated local phase aberrations are inherently assigned
to the erroneous echo positions, as previously noted by other
authors [21]. Second, the model (20) relies on the approxima-
tion (11), which assumes small deviations δx between x and
r, such that t(δx) ≈t0(δx). This approximation introduces a
mismatch between the true and predicted deviations, related
by δx ∝(c0/ctrue)δxtrue. For strong aberrations, typically
occurring at greater depths, the model (20) no longer describes
the measured phases accurately. This effect, not previously ad-
dressed, is illustrated in Fig. 4, which compares measured and
modeled correlation phases for analytically computed data in
a homogeneous medium. For c0 < ctrue, reconstructed echoes
are systematically shallower than their true positions, and this
deviation is underestimated by the approximation in (11). As
a result, modeled phases (orange dashed line) are smaller
than the measured ones (black solid line) or, equivalently,

Measured correlation phases (black solid) versus the analytical
predictions from (20), shown with (orange dashed) and without (gray

speed of sound ctrue = 1525 m/s. The assumed speed of sound is
c0 = 1400 m/s (top) and c0 = 1650 m/s (bottom), corresponding
to the same absolute mismatch relative to ctrue. These values span
the typical range of speed of sound encountered in tissue. Measured
phases are computed using φm = 0, φd,1 = 25◦, and φd,2 = 23◦,
a center frequency of 5 MHz with a fractional bandwidth of 50 %, and
a correlation kernel size L = 2 mm. These parameters were chosen
based on previous work in CUTE [15]. Correlations are averaged over
50 realizations of diffuse scatterers.
shifted to deeper regions showing a reduced gradient versus
depth. In contrast, for c0 > ctrue, the misplacement of echoes
is overestimated, yielding systematically larger absolute phase
values at each location. Interestingly, Fig. 4 also shows that
neglecting the angle-dependent factor α (gray dotted lines)
makes phase modeling errors asymmetric with respect to c0.
The approximation in (11) is essential to linearize the
relationship between the correlation phases ϕ and the phase
aberrations ∆t. In addition, CUTE employs further lineariza-
tions by (i) treating ∆t as the phase aberration at the true
echo position and (ii) assuming straight-ray propagation to re-
late ∆t to the tissue speed-of-sound distribution [15], thereby
neglecting refraction and finite-frequency effects [22]. Even
without the latter approximation, echo mislocalization alone
introduces nonlinearities in the relationship between ϕ and
the speed of sound. Future speed-of-sound imaging algorithms
based on common-mid-angle correlations should therefore use
iterative strategies to progressively correct aberrations and
reduce phase-modeling errors.
D. Comment on Ensemble Averaging
Equation (20) models the phase of the ensemble-averaged
correlations. In practice, however, we use single realizations
to reduce acquisition time and minimize motion artifacts. This
can be justified if (i) tissue is spatially ergodic, namely
lim
L→∞
1
L
Z
˜χ(r + δx1)˜χ(r + δx2)dr = ⟨˜χ(x1)˜χ(x2)⟩, (21)
with xi = r + δxi [23], and (ii) aberrations are constant
over the correlation kernel L (isoplanatism). Under these
conditions, the correlation integral in (8) replaces the ensemble
averaging. Nevertheless, an inherent trade-off exists: a large L
improves convergence to the expected value in (20) but may
violate the assumption of isoplanatism, which generally holds
only for small L. This trade-off constrains the choice of L and
increases the uncertainty of phase estimates. The following
section provides a detailed analysis of these uncertainties.
III. FLUCTUATIONS OF COMMON-MID-ANGLE
CORRELATION PHASES
Even in the absence of external noise and modeling er-
rors, correlation-phase measurements fluctuate around their
expected value (20) due to the intrinsic randomness of speckle.
In this section, we quantify and discuss the fundamental
accuracy limit imposed by speckle by deriving a closed-form
expression for the correlation-phase variance.
A. Analytical Derivation of Correlation-Phase Variance
With a slight abuse of notation, let ϕ denote the argument
of the correlation C measured from a single realization, i.e.,
ϕ(ξ) = arg (C(ξ)) = arctan
Im(C(ξ))
Re(C(ξ))

.
(22)
We use ⟨ϕ⟩to denote the phase of ensemble-averaged correla-
tions ⟨C⟩studied in the previous section. In order to quantify
the fluctuations of ϕ due to speckle, we compute its variance
σ2
ϕ by propagating the uncertainties of the real and imaginary
parts of C:
σ2
ϕ =
1
|⟨C⟩|2

⟨Im(C)2⟩cos2⟨ϕ⟩+ ⟨Re(C)2⟩sin2⟨ϕ⟩
−⟨Re(C) Im(C)⟩sin (2⟨ϕ⟩)] .
(23)
Since the three terms in σ2
ϕ require similar calculations, we de-
rive ⟨Im(C)2⟩here and provide only the results for ⟨Re(C)2⟩
and ⟨Re(C) Im(C)⟩. These involve fourth-order correlations
of the scattering function ˜χ, which is modeled as a zero-mean
real Gaussian random field [23], [24]:
⟨˜χ(x1)˜χ(x2)˜χ(x3)˜χ(x4)⟩= ˜X2[δ(x1 −x2)δ(x3 −x4)
+ δ(x1 −x3)δ(x2 −x4) + δ(x1 −x4)δ(x2 −x3)].
(24)
As a result, ⟨Im(C)2⟩is composed of three terms:

The variance contribution of this term is determined by the
magnitude of the correlation ⟨C⟩. For the derivations below, it
is useful to recall its exact expression, derived in Appendix II:
|⟨C⟩|2 = a(ξ)2 ˜X2 ≈2πσ2

0(ξ) ˜X2,
(28)
with B0(ξ) defined in (50). The last step assumes small
angular differences between correlated images, as is common
practice to avoid phase wrapping when |ϕ| ≥π.
In contrast to the first term, the variance contributions
of Prr′
2
and Prr′
3
arise from the interference between re-
constructed echoes at different locations. This interference
depends on the relative travel-time differences τi between the
locations r and r′. It is therefore convenient to write τ r′

The first term is approximately 1 when φ1 and φ2 are very
close, as assumed here. Unlike the other terms, which oscillate
rapidly with the integration variable ui, this first term is
constant in ui; thus, it dominates the integral in (32). With
this approximation, substituting the PSF product (30) into (32)

B. Physical Interpretation of the Variance
Several conclusions can be drawn from the expression of σ2
ϕ
in (39). First, the variance of correlation-phase measurements
scales as 1/N, where N = L/¯σA is the number of resolution
cells within the correlation kernel. This is consistent with
Sec. II-D: if tissue is spatially ergodic, each resolution cell acts
as an independent realization of disorder, so the correlation
integral approximates the ensemble average. As N increases,
correlation phases more closely match their expected value.

phase aberrations) increase in magnitude. (b) Observed (gray) and

of sound (c0
= 1475 m/s) was used in this case to avoid phase
wrapping. The black line is the mean phase over 50 realizations of
the diffuse scatterers, whereas gray lines show the measured phases
for each realization. Orange dashed lines indicate the 95% confidence
interval predicted from (39). As the aberrations increase with depth, the
correlation-phase variance increases accordingly.
For a fixed L, the number of resolution cells increases when
¯σA decreases. This is the average width of the PSF along the
mid-angle direction ˆkm:

The PSF becomes narrower when the emitted signals have a
larger bandwidth (∝1/σ) and data is acquired with a smaller
angle difference φd,i. As a result of the latter, phase estimates
are noisier for larger φd,i values, an effect that can be observed
in [25] (e.g., see their Fig. 2).
While the dependence on N is largely intuitive and has
been discussed previously [12], [15], our result in (39) reveals
that aberrations directly affect the correlation-phase variance.
Aberrations appear through the term B2
0, which measures
the intensity at the location where correlation phases are
extracted (Fig. 5(a)). Essentially, B2
0 quantifies the degree of
coherence between the reconstructed images, and the phase
variance scales with the relative loss of coherence, expressed
as B−2
0
−1 = (1 −B2
0)/B2
0. As shown in Appendix II,
B2
0 decreases with |ϕ|; thus, the phase variance grows with
the magnitude of the phases themselves. The stronger the
aberrations, the larger the shift between reconstructed echoes
and the lower the peak intensity B2
0 (Fig. 5(a)), ultimately
leading to a larger uncertainty in phase estimation (Fig. 5(b)).
If the magnitude of unwrapped phases is small relative to σωc
(i.e., the inverse of the fractional bandwidth), the variance
becomes linearly related to ⟨ϕ⟩2:
σ2
ϕ(ξ) ≈
√π
Nω2cσ2β+ ⟨ϕ(ξ)⟩2,
(41)
with β+ defined in (51), Appendix II. This result implies that,
in the absence of aberrations (i.e., ⟨ϕ⟩= 0), uncertainties
in common-mid-angle correlation phases become negligible.
This is consistent with the same effect observed in the phase
shifts between two arbitrary speckle signals [26]. Note that
the correlation-phase variance is a local quantity; it becomes
negligible whenever the local correlation phase is zero.
Strikingly, (41) shows that phase uncertainty increases with
the fractional bandwidth. This may appear counterintuitive, as
a larger bandwidth narrows the PSFs and increases the number
of resolution cells within the correlation kernel, as discussed
above. However, for a fixed ϕ, a broader bandwidth also
reduces the overlap between the two PSFs, thereby decreasing
B2
0. In other words, aberrations cause coherence to decay
more rapidly with increasing bandwidth. The effect of both
bandwidth and kernel size on σ2
ϕ is shown in Fig. 6. Note
that, although reducing the bandwidth as much as possible
may seem attractive for minimizing σ2
ϕ, the model in (39) is no
longer valid when the correlation kernel becomes comparable
to the PSFs (see the assumption in (35)).
C. Comment on the Influence of Clutter
Equation (39) describes the aberration-induced phase vari-
ance and defines the achievable phase accuracy of common-
mid-angle correlations in the absence of noise. We have shown
that this variance is proportional to the loss of coherence
caused by phase aberrations, although the same reasoning
extends to any other factor that degrades coherence, including
clutter arising from thermal and electronic noise, multiple
scattering, or reverberations. A detailed analysis of clutter-
induced variance is beyond the scope of this work; nev-
ertheless, two remarks can be made regarding its expected
behavior. First, clutter is often largely uncorrelated across
different transmit and receive plane waves. As discussed at the
beginning of Sec II, in practice, slight transmit and receive
focusing is typically applied through coherent compounding
before computing correlations [15]. This focusing reduces
clutter and thus its contribution to the phase variance. Second,
part of the clutter is expected to be spatially uncorrelated,
so its variance contribution scales inversely with the number
of resolution cells N. As a result, increasing the bandwidth
may decrease the total variance, potentially outweighing the
increase predicted by (41). The following section experimen-
tally validates the predicted variance and further illustrates the
joint effect of aberrations and clutter.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
In this section, we aim to evaluate how well the model
in (39) explains the fluctuations observed in experimental

(c)-(d) Data is simulated with a fractional bandwidth of 100 % and 25 %, respectively. In each panel, the black line represents the mean phase over

correlation-phase measurements and whether the predicted
dependence of the variance on the correlation phase, kernel
size, and bandwidth is observed experimentally.
The analysis is performed using the same dataset previously
employed for calibration in [27]. Data were acquired in a
custom-made, tissue-mimicking CIRS phantom (Computer-
ized Imaging Reference Systems, Inc. Norfolk, VA, USA)
with uniform scattering properties and constant speed of sound
of 1518 m/s (Fig. 7(b)). The experimental setup consisted
of a SuperSonic® MACH® 30 ultrasound system (Hologic®
- Supersonic Imagine®, Aix-en-Provence, France) equipped
with an L18-5 linear probe containing 256 elements with a
pitch of 0.2 mm. Steered plane-wave emissions were used
at angles ranging from -27.5◦to 27.5◦, with an angular
step of 0.5◦, and the center frequency was 6.5 MHz with
50% fractional bandwidth. This dataset contains 20 repeated
measurements at different locations of the phantom to mimic
different realizations of disorder.
For our analysis, we reconstruct transmit-receive plane-wave
images according to (2)–(4) using the same set of angles
as in transmission. As discussed in Sec. III-C, we apply
coherent compounding to reduce clutter before computing
correlations. Following previous works in CUTE [15], we
define compounding angles ranging from −25◦to 25◦in steps
of 2◦and synthetically focus in emission and reception using
a Gaussian weighting function with a standard deviation of
3◦/
√
2. Due to the lateral resolution achieved through com-
pounding, we restrict our analysis to the mid-lateral position.
Finally, correlations are computed using (8) at the mid-angle
φm = 0 to illustrate how the correlation phases evolve with
depth, as aberrations increase.
As shown in Fig. 7(a), the theoretical predictions based
on the mean phase values closely match the experimentally
measured phase variance. This result confirms that phase
estimation becomes more uncertain when aberrations increase
in magnitude, a key finding of this work. Deviations from the
theoretical model mainly occur when the correlation phases
are relatively small, approximately within the first centimeter
of depth. Here, the measured σϕ is about 150% higher than
the theoretical prediction, whereas at larger depths the relative
difference drops below 1%. The loss of coherence between
correlated images at shallow depths is primarily caused by
clutter, which dominates the total phase variance.
Because both aberration- and clutter-induced variances scale
inversely with the number of resolution cells, the relative
difference between measured and predicted σϕ remains un-
changed when the kernel size is reduced by half (Fig. 7(c)).
However, the variance reduction for a narrower bandwidth
observed in Fig. 6 is less evident in Fig. 7(d). Compared to the
full-bandwidth case, σϕ appears to decrease slightly, e.g., by
about 20% at depths of 3-4 cm, but it becomes nearly three
times larger at shallow regions (Fig. 7(e)). This clearly re-
flects the two competing mechanisms discussed earlier. While
narrowing the bandwidth reduces aberration-induced variance,
it also decreases the number of resolution cells, making the
influence of clutter on phase estimates more pronounced.
These experimental results confirm that the theoretical
model developed here provides a lower bound on the

correlation-phase variance and therefore tells us how accu-
rately correlation phases can, in principle, be estimated. The
model could be used to construct a data-covariance operator
for speed-of-sound inversion that weights phase measurements
according to their reliability in order to improve robustness.
V. CONCLUSION
We have developed a theoretical formalism to relate
common-mid-angle speckle correlations to the phase aber-
rations arising from speed-of-sound inhomogeneities. This
formalism (i) completes and clarifies previously established
models describing a linear relationship between correlation
phases and the mismatches between the assumed and true
travel times and (ii) enables the prediction of correlation-
phase fluctuations resulting from aberration-induced speckle
decorrelation.
For image pairs obtained with transmit–receive angles shar-
ing a common mid-angle, phase aberrations manifest as dis-
placements of reconstructed echoes along the same direction.
The relative shift in echoes between the two images is what
determines the correlation values at each location. We have
shown that the phase of the correlations scales linearly with
the relative echo shift, whereas the correlation magnitude,
which reflects the coherence between the two images, decays
exponentially with the square of correlation phases. A second-
order statistical analysis revealed that this loss of coherence
with increasing phase magnitude reduces the reliability of
correlation-phase estimates, a phenomenon we have experi-
mentally verified in a uniform tissue-mimicking phantom.
Common mid-angle correlations were originally introduced
to quantify the speed-of-sound distribution using CUTE. The
formalism developed here therefore naturally provides both
physical insight and a theoretical basis for advancing speed-of-
sound imaging. More broadly, it establishes a benchmark for
comparing the fundamental accuracy limits of more advanced
aberration-estimation techniques, including those based on
time-reversal analysis [9], [11] and the Radon transform [28].
